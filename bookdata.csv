"1","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","Russian aristocracy following the Russian Revolution","Kansabelle","0143110438","R2UFCQ9WES7VFH","1555241537","A great read. In addition to the plot, characters, hidden treasure etc. I enjoyed the philosophical question: do Russians destroy more of what they create more than other cultures? Even if you stick to the characters-great fun.",4
"2","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","Knowing nothing ahead of time just walk into the story without expectations and become charmed.","D.P. McHenry","0143110438","R24B1HA9J9I99G","1555241542","Great story, well told. Characters were well developed. Ending was perfect!",4
"3","Pet Sematary: A Novel","One of King's finest, most frightening, & early works","Gordon Hoffman","198211598X","R1P137WFADSBYR","1555241649","Only the second novel written and published under King's name, and not as Richard Bachman, it is clear that King now has grown into his craft. ""The Shining"" remains one of the most frightening of King's books, and accomplishes something that the King novels of today are incapable of doing:  presenting intricately flawed characters in less than 1,000 pages.  The characters of Jack & Danny, and Jack's influence of Danny's development into an adult (which one reads about in ""Dr. Sleep"") are nothing short of brilliant.  As is always the case, the book offers the reader so much more than the movie or the TV mini-series derived from it.  A staple in the King/Bachman enthusiast's library!  Buy it today!",4

"5","Supermarket","AMAZING, BOBBY","D. Mahoney","1982127139","R1D6LXSDR0CRMN","1555242169","As someone who hates reading and never really got into any books in school, this book is a masterpiece. Don't think, just buy it asap. You won't regret it.",4
"7","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","A really fun read","Cynthia A. Brown","62678426","R9SS7KKEMALUA","1555242471","This was one of those books you definitely don't want to start reading at bedtime because you will be up half the night. It's well written and well plotted, a really fun read.",4
"8","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","So truly enjoyable!","Joan's opinion","0143110438","R36AY8YY0XVQG7","1555242497","What a treat this book has been for me!  I'm not yet finished and I'm actually afraid to finish it because I've so enjoyed it so, it's going to be a loss for me!  A great tale that's engaging and fun.  It's been a long time since I've read something like this and it's been incredibly refreshing to be able to enjoy something that's light and beautiful!",4

"10","Run Away","Not one of his best","Asmeret","1538748460","R555JBAR1GW3I","1555242577","I found the beginning to be a little slow and this is not one of his best books, but I love his books, overall, so I forgave him for this one. Hopefully this is the last one. It's difficult to drive while rolling your eyes to the back of your head.",3
"11","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","Beautiful","Linda Fitzgerald","0143110438","R1UZGXNUNQ7M50","1555242617","It's not often that I decide to take a few days break until I start another book, but I enjoyed Amor Towles book so much I want to savour it for a while before I lose the magic. Beautiful tale superbly told.",4
"12","Metropolis (A Bernie Gunther Novel)","The last returns to the quality of the first few","Daniel S. Palter","0735218897","R2JR4B4PGJ1QHJ","1555242682","I'm a longtime fan of the series, but as my prior reviews showed, the last few books have been formulaic. Kerr simply didn't handle the 50's as well as he had the early days of the Nazis. So this return to a much younger Bernie, Weimar and the Nazis as a cloud on the horizon rather than the center piece of the story, was wonderful. Its sad that Mr Kerr is dead and thus Bernie with him, but at least he took his final bows on a wonderful who done it.",4
"13","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","Don't open this book if you have work to do. It is impossible to put down. What a ride!

"17","QAnon: An Invitation to The Great Awakening","A book with a message for today","Nely","1942790139","R2MVC1E3KSJMUR","1555242922","Growing up in America, the message from church was there would be a war someday between good and evil.  You always think that it won't happen in your lifetime.  This book is providing information about our world and what has been happening while we were sitting back listening to the main stream media.  We have been lied to.  We have been made to believe that the right calls the left demons and they and the media laugh it off.  That is part of the plan.  The war is here.  The war between God and Satan.  Read the book.  Do your own research.  Get behind our President.  It is not about who is the President, it is about saving our country from the traitors.",4

The characters are fascinating and the story engaging...can't  put it down.  The surprises for me was reading this at the car wash and a gal sitting opposite me...said ""are you loving the book, I won't tell you the ending and you'll be surprising""  She leaves and a gentleman sat in her seat and asked ""where are you in the book?  It is a terrific story and the ending is a surprise""  I'm almost through...what will I read next that will be as good?",4
"26","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","An OK read if there's nothing else around","doug","0143110438","R10WATT6V8HRJY","1555243697","""Gentleman"" was an interesting read but not compelling. There was a good deal of plot jumping around. It needed a good edit.",2
"28","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Just as scary now!","Kalona1982","198211598X","R144ERJMUUT2X4","1555243873","If anything it was more scary.  I read it during the Halloween season, and it was the perfect read.  I love King - I don't love all his books, but this was one of his finest.  Highly recommended.  If you saw the movie, like I did, you might find yourself transposing the movie characters into the book as you read it.  I did that, couldn't help it, and it seemed to work ok.",4
"29","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","The book was in great shape when it arrived","Dorothea B. Jirsa","0143110438","R189HIVBID8ZN5","1555243877","The book was in great shape when it arrived.  It was a very interesting story.  From the first page, I wanted to know more and more about the""gentleman"".  Good background on Russian history of the first half of the 20th century.  The main character was such a unique person.  Despite what fate dealt him, he remained kind, gentle, and always a gentleman.  He kept up with the world events,  never lowered his own standards, and treated everyone with respect.  When I finished reading the book, I wanted to read it all again.",4

"32","Free to Focus: A Total Productivity System to Achieve More by Doing Less","Gives you the tools to help the productivity stick!","Ashley W","0801075262","R1DTLSSGUP2QHR","1555243988","I’ve read my share of productivity books over the years and maybe picked up a quick trick here and there but that’s just what they were-quick tricks. This book got me to go deeper. Free to focus was easy to understand but went one step further than other books, since it comes with links to resources-exercises you do after each section that have you apply what you’re learning to your own life.

I think this is what sets this book apart. It’s easy to read about cutting things from your list, it’s another to actually list out your tasks and do it. I also learned about things I thought I knew how to do, like delegation ... now I realize that I don’t do this as effectively or as intentionally as I could.

This book also acknowledges the importance of self-care in recharging so there's energy for productivity. Rather than the more, more, more burnout philosophy of other productivity systems.

This is the last productivity book that I’ll ever need to read, and you too...",4

"50","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","Fantasy","DBW","0143110438","R2H5YREJDRF2Q5","1555245797","The Count may have been a gentleman but this certainly was NOT Moscow during that time period!!! I was disappointed in this fantasy from the start  however I continued to read hoping to find some redeeming value on the last page. Wrong!  My worry is that people will view this work as factual when they should ask one of the few Romanov's who actually survived or the  60 million people that were killed thereafter, what life was like during those times! SoSo, Stalin, was a madman plain and simple! Bolsheviks were animals, plain and simple. The writing was good and the author certainly made clear of his expertise on all subjects through his character, the Count, but one thing very important this was lacking....he new nothing of life in Moscow then!!",1

I also liked the character of Count Rostov.  He was cultured, educated, intelligent, generous,interested and interesting,romantic.  I enjoyed his interactions with all of the people he came in contact with.  I loved his relationship with the child of his old friend and fellow adventurer, Nina.  It seemed that his imposed sentence actually gave him the freedom to discover himself.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story.",4
