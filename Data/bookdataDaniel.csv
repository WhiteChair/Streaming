"1","Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...","gripping, informative, complete","Keith A. Comess","0143132504","RCXJRKN5RRD5Q","1554882185","Eight days it took me to read through this monster of a sequel to Ghost Wars.

It helps, of course, that the author is discussing history here. Ghost Wars was all about the tragic mistakes that led up to Al Qaeda’s “finest hour,” the simultaneous assassination of Ahmad Shah Massoud in Afghanistan and the felling of the twin towers in September of 2001.

Directorate S is about Afghani history since September 2001, told from the angle of the invading Americans. It’s 700 pages short.

That the book is named after Directorate S, the section within Pakistan’s secret services (the I.S.I.) that has secretly supported the Taliban since September 11, strongly hints toward the fact that Steve Coll ultimately has enormous sympathy for Hamid Karzai’s chief argument: America and its allies may well have felt they had no alternative to invading Afghanistan after nine-eleven, but they never stood a chance of defeating the Taliban, due to the Taliban’s ability to always withdraw and regroup in the Waziristan province of Pakistan.

He never says so outright, however. He tells the story as best he can. And it’s a thriller.

Steve Coll mixes history, biography, politics and individual memoirs to deliver a step-by-step account of the “with us or against us” dilemma that Musharraf had to answer pretty much same-day (his Secret Services’ inability and unwillingness to deliver it and the political impossibility for Pakistan to do so notwithstanding), the immediate success of the invading NATO forces in ousting the Taliban, the establishment of the Karzai government, its failure to govern, the Obama / McChrystal / Petraeus surge, whose fate may have been sealed by its built-in sell-by date, the fiasco that were the 2009 elections for everybody involved, the WWI-style horror of the warfare to regain Helmand for no particular end-goal, the surge of green-on-blue attacks, the failure of Holbrooke’s and Hillary’s effort to bring the Taliban to the table and the eventual breakdown of the relationship between the US and its primary interlocutor in the area, the I.S.I.’s Ashfaq Kayani, who emerges as the main character of this saga.

Coll never loses you. He has a five-page reference section at the front, listing the names of all the protagonists in the book. He builds them well enough for you to always know who he’s talking about. I only maybe looked at it five times as he took me through the three-dimensional chess involving the US, the Karzai government in Kabul, the Taliban leadership, the Pakistani military leadership and the Pakistani secret services, with walk-in roles for the Saudis, the Qataris, the Afghan secret service, the Pakistani political leadership, and never forgetting the soldiers, analysts and spies who fought the war in the trenches.

Part of the reason you stay with him is you get the full briefing regarding where everybody’s coming from and how everybody feels about it: crazy Karzai thinks both Pakistan and the US want to replace him, his buddy (and US envoy/ambassador) Khalilzad simply cannot convince him otherwise; Pakistan sees Indian influence everywhere and can only see the Afghan struggle in the context of the threat that India will engulf it from both sides; the US is split four ways between the bullish Pentagon, the disbelieving C.I.A., the can-do / must-do White house and the hyperactive State Department. The Taliban are always there and, in stark contrast with their double-dealing Pakistani supporters, totally unwilling to show two faces, or even one, for that matter.

Finally, the voice of the low-ranking participant is heard loud and clear, be it the US soldier writing back to his family, the misrepresented Panshjiri who is forced to bet on Kabul, or the Pashto-speaking peasant who must pick sides (let alone crops), all while observing the bumbling western invaders prioritizing their own safety over showing a morsel of respect for a country they purport to have saved, driving away from the scene of many an accident and occasionally using indiscriminate violence.

Lest I have not made it clear, however, and much as the book is told from the American angle, the main protagonists here are the Pakistani army and the Pakistani secret services. It is in their back yard that the fight is taking place. Their support for the Taliban comes from the fact that they will need them there in Afghanistan after the Americans leave. This support is very costly, because it acts as an incubator for terrorism and violence that is primarily directed toward Pakistan itself, if perhaps more successfully toward secular Pakistan than toward people in uniform. Ultimately, however, they run a corrupt and leaky enough set of institutions that their request to be in the middle of every negotiation cannot be taken seriously, the proof being that the Americans go ahead and kill Osama bin Laden in total secrecy. If that was the straw that broke the camel’s back or merely a symptom of a broken relationship is not really a topic that makes the final cut for these 700 very dense pages.

The summary of those fifteen years is given on page 664 and I don’t think one can give it any better than the author himself: “…even without Iraq or Guantanamo the United States would have struggled to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Primarily this was because two administrations led by presidents of different political parties could not resolve essential questions about the conflict. Did they truly believe that Afghanistan’s independence and stability was more important than Pakistan’s stability? Why did they accept I.S.I.’s support for the Taliban even when it directly undermined American interests and American lives? If they were to try to stop I.S.I.’s cover action, what risks were they prepared to take? Inside Afghanistan, which was more important: to work with unsavory but sometimes effective warlords and militias against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or to promote decent government, even if the attempt to do so created instability? How important was drug enforcement, if the anti-drug campaign risked alienating farmers and laborers in Taliban country? The Taliban might be abhorrent, but did the movement pose a direct threat to the United States? If the Afghan war could be settled only by peace talks that included as much of the Taliban as possible, as many at the highest levels of the Obama administration came to believe after 2010, why was this daunting project left to a secret cell of negotiators and not made a higher, more explicit priority of the United States, as were the comparably risky negotiations with Iran and Cuba undertaken during Obama’s second term?

And that’s Steve Coll’s long epitaph for a struggle America was forced into without having even worked out its own motivations, let alone the potential consequences.

It’s dynamite.",5
"2","Cemetery Road: A Novel","Sometimes the price of justice is a good man’s soul.","ZOMGPWN<U+2757>","0062824619","RB15ZUZQATDX5","1554882246","Before I read The Quiet Game by Iles I had never even heard of him. After I saw the reviews of the Penn Cage series and saw the themes and content, it looked like a no-brainer for me. I'm so happy that I read that entire series. However, after finishing it, the bar was set pretty darn high for me, as far as what I expect from this guy's imagination. I'm happy to say that Cemetery Road met that expectation. I'm not sure what specific sub-genre Iles inhabits but I think of it as ""Post-Southern Gothic Literary Murder Mystery Thriller."" I think that covers all the bases.Cemetery Road is par for the course for Greg Iles but Iles' typical course is a cut above the usual for this type of literature. The themes here are all familiar, but harrowing and emotional. Loss, betrayal, redemption, doing what's right for others vs. doing what's right for oneself... not to mention murder most foul and a grand cabal weaving an evil conspiracy that envelops an entire town in its corrupting influence. Protagonist Marshall McEwan is the prodigal son returned home to take care of his ailing father and the family's sputtering yet once legendary newspaper. When McEwan's most revered mentor turns up floating in the Mississippi with a skull fracture, the intrigue begins and the tension continues to build until the frantic climax.The characters here are mostly complex and all have parts of their nature that are unlikeable and/or not very nice. That's part of what Iles is exploring with this book. Not just the nature of good vs. evil but how we can oversimplify those definitions and sometimes confuse doing what's virtuous with doing what's right. When push comes to shove, sometimes people have to make hard choices and even do things that hurt some people to save others.Yes, there is some mention of current politics and/or media coverage of politics in this book, but to me, it wasn't obnoxious or overwhelming. The characters have opinions and for me, that's just fine. It doesn't get in the way of the story at all and in fact, informs the thoughts and actions of certain characters, providing motivation and or reasoning for their actions. Cemetery Road is not a political screed or diatribe... not by a long shot. Iles is merely placing the story and the characters in the current real-world setting.The plot is tightly wound and the action builds nicely. There was no huge ""twist"" or gut punch for me in the plot... I pretty much saw most of it coming but I still really enjoyed every minute of it. I just like the way Iles writes and how he tells a story. He is great at writing exciting dialogue and moving a story along with a satisfying pace. Perhaps growing up in a town of a similar size and temperament as Bienville makes this book more enjoyable for me, but I think anyone can enjoy the setting. Another great read from Greg Iles. I hope we get more books in this setting since there were still many areas to explore with Marshall, the Mathesons and the whole town.",5

I have owned Kubrick's classic since its arrival, and it has always been one of my favorites.Well, forget the movie, because this book is absolutely unbelievable.  From the very beginning, maybe from anticipation, but most likely from the way Mr. King keeps you on the edge of your seat, bed, hell...on your feet...this book is frightening.Because of the masterful storytelling and descriptive power, I found myself, after the first night, not wanting to pick this book back up, out of sheer terror.  When I finally talked myself into it, I could not put it down.  Amazing how quiet, yet truly alive, your own home feels, late at night, when there is nothing but your thoughts, awakened by this masterpiece.Truly unbelievable is the way so very many character's, from Jack, Wendy, Danny and TONY, to Halloran, Lloyd (who could forget good old Lloyd) and the undeniable Grady, are intertwined in a way the movie only begins to uncover.If you like a good scare, one that wears on you from beginning to end, and truly appreciate the art of imagination, you must give this book a read.  Once you do, you will need to watch the movie, again, just to calm yourself down.",5
"11","Cemetery Road: A Novel","""All Roads Lead Home"" -- But Home Is ""Cemetery Road"".","Scott E. High","0062824619","RUANHLXH9D3SL","1554882966","It's worth giving Greg Iles a pass on his politics to read this finely crafted novel.  After all, 50% of our population lies on either side of the line drawn in the sand.  The fact that I'm a conservative shouldn't require me to bash a liberal's work.""Cemetery Road"" is a well plotted multi-generational tale of small town corruption extending back to the Civil War.  Mr. Iles takes you on a fast-paced yet intricate ride through the politics and hidden agendas of Beinville, Mississippi, a small town that has somehow managed to hold its own while most other river towns have given up the ghost.  The ironic title of this novel works well here, covering the bases of each plot thread as it unravels -- from private family deceptions to those bringing collateral damage for everyone in the town.This timely premise involves a Chinese company finding a home for their new billion dollar factory in Bienville.  The large investment in this small town will bring prosperity to a lot of the local population as well as improving highway access that will also expand the local community.  But the biggest beneficiaries of all will be members of the Bienville Poker Club, a group of corrupt businessmen who ancestors have controlled Bienville since The Reconstruction(1865-1877).However there is a dangerous complication, something that would cause all of their investments to collapse on them.  The site of the new factory has been partially excavated by an amateur archeologist who believes that the site was the home of a native culture occupying it 4,000 years ago.  Pursuing protection for this historical site will cause all of the Poker Club's complicated manipulations to go up in smoke -- and the local population to lose all of the benefits and amenities they are counting on.As always, Greg Iles delivers a well researched and fast moving novel with stark narrative and intricate personal relationships.  Not all is what it seems to be but suffice it to say that not every player trusts even his/her closest associates/relatives.  It appears to be ""all for one and one for all"", until suddenly it doesn't.  More complicated then his previous works, the issues here range from interpersonal relationships to international issues.  Well worth your time!",5

"37","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","Superb","David Island","0143110438","R1UCRD4L4XGDZI","1554884837","“A Gentleman in Moscow” by American author Amor Towles is probably the best novel you will ever read about Soviet Union Russia. The #1 star is Count Alexander Rostov, a “Former Person” of the Tsarist Aristocracy, who, in 1922 rather than being shot, is sentenced to live out his entire life within the 4 walls of the Metropol Hotel in central Moscow. His mantra is “If you do not master circumstances, circumstances will master you.”  He is right, and he does exactly that. So, for 32 years we live with him at the Metropol.There are 2 other stars.  Star #2 is Nina, a 9 year old girl whom the Count befriends early in his stay at the hotel. They become best buddies and explore (under the direction of very bright and headstrong Nina) the nooks and crannies of the hotel, from  hidden rooms in the basement to roof-top, and into various guest rooms, aided by a master key she has liberated from…….somewhere.  And years later, Star #3 is another girl, Sofia, the 5 year-old daughter of the then-grown-up Nina, who is left for a “few weeks” in Alexander’s care. She stays permanently, Nina never returns, and thus a major portion of the book is devoted to Sofia’s rearing by the bachelor Alexander within the limitations of an elegant hotel out of which he cannot venture.  Much later, as a young adult, Sofia has become a talented and successful classical pianist.  The entire story is charming, deeply emotional, and full of humor and insight into the state of personal and international affairs.  Alexander learns how to be a parent and masters his circumstances with aplomb.The book abounds with episodes involving the new Communist ruling elite, how the political situation is reflected in changes in the hotel’s staff, and who comes and goes through its doors.  The Count lives half his life in this hotel.  His expenses are covered by a secret cache of gold he has horded away, a remainder of his aristocratic past.  He lives like a monk in an attic room and eventually serves as the Maitre D’ of the hotel’s elegant main restaurant, which seems to have suffered very little under Communism.  In this position, he is able to observe closely and gently the intimate history of the first 30-odd years of Soviet Russia.The well-set up denouement is a masterpiece.I neither understood nor liked the final dozen or so pages of the book.  What was that all about? I found those final pages puzzling and strange. The writing for the most part (except the final few pages) was sublime and filled with pithy insights and clever phrasing, such as, when Nina left for the hinterlands, “in the general direction of historical necessity” (at about 40%).  Or, in referring to the count’s situation as a membership in the “Confederacy of the Humbled” (at about 42%).  The only bone I have to pick with the writing is that too much of the dialogue is 21st Century American English, with a fair sprinkling of American slang. I don’t know why that bothered me, since the author is American, but it did.All-in-all, “A Gentleman in Moscow” is a scintillating read, and I rate it at 4.49, rounded down to a 4. Highly recommended. It may be one of the best historical novels you will have the pleasure of reading.",4

"47","Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret...","If You’re Not Winning, You’re Losing. And yet you don’t know how to quit","Keith A. Comess","0143132504","R193JBQOMOOF58","1554885970","Directorate S derives its name from a branch of Pakistani intelligence. Although the role of Pakistan is prominent in author Steve Coll’s examination of America’s struggle in Afghanistan, this is a larger and more complex analysis of what has become a war without end.

If you’re not winning, you’re losing. One could be reading about the failed strategy in Vietnam as we learn about General Petraeus’ military solution to defeating Al Qaeda and its Taliban protectors in Afghanistan. The strategy was “Clear, Hold, Build, and Transfer.” As with Vietnam, in most of the countryside the US has never gotten beyond a temporary “Clear”, followed by US withdrawal from territory gained after suffering casualties, followed by reoccupation by our adversaries.

Afghanistan has a long history of defeating foreign occupiers, ranging from the British in the 19th Century, to the Russian incursion, to the US effort in a violent region suspicious of foreign intervention. Coll recounts how Americans had no local knowledge and used drones and incursions to take out Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, resulting in civilian casualties and alienating the populace.

In Vietnam, “victory” was measured by body count. Here the military defined progress by dividing the country into 400 sectors and then color-coding each in green, yellow or red. After several years, there has been little change in the colors and policy makers have realized that, at best, the US has achieved stalemate. Today’s Wall Street Journal (July 30, 2018) reports that government-controlled sectors are only about 120 out of 400.

After 17 years of US involvement including more than $1 trillion in treasure and some 2,400 American lives, the Taliban and other warlords control most of the countryside, territory into which American troops dare not venture without taking unacceptable casualties.

American involvement in Afghanistan differs from that of Vietnam in two key respects.

First, the burden of combat falls upon our professional soldiers, the 1% of our population who now serve. Many of these young men and women have served two, three, even six or more combat tours. Is it likely that we would still be militarily involved after 17 years if young draftees were still being fed into an endless war, with a high percentage of families seeing their sons, daughters, siblings killed or wounded?

Secondly, the complexity of this conflict makes Vietnam seem simple and straightforward. Afghanistan shares a mountainous, ungoverned border which the Pakistani government doesn’t fully control and which is impossible to seal. The Afghan government under Hamid Karzai and his successors has been corrupt, weak, and lacking legitimacy (in this respect much as the regimes in South Vietnam).

If that weren’t challenging enough, Pakistan has many reasons to support the Taliban, including internal pressures from its own Islamic militants, a Pashtun minority that occupies both sides of the Afghan/Pakistan border, paranoia about India’s influence in the country, and a deep distrust of the US.

Coll’s book chronicles US unwillingness to abandon the war and our reluctance to challenge Pakistan even as it supports Taliban militants who harbor terrorists and kill our troops. The US is dependent upon bringing military supplies through Pakistan, and recognizes, as Vice President Joe Biden observes about a nation with nuclear weapons, “Pakistan is 50 times more important than Afghanistan for the United States.”

Coll’s knowledge of Afghanistan is impressive and he provides clarity to a complex story. Sadly, the reader comes away deeply depressed as the US doesn’t know how to win and doesn’t know how to quit.",5

She took gems from many of her interviews and made them easily accessible to us all. Then the seeds that she plants in these pages are supercharged with her powerful positive intentions.
This book is packed with fantastic comments from many highly inspired souls. I found them to be immensely valuable. But I mostly enjoyed Oprah’s descriptions of her personal experiences at the beginning of each chapter. By sharing the examples and events that brought her to her thinking and to her level of knowingness, she takes us with her and provides an opportunity for the reader to really hear and to better understand the concepts that she is sharing.
The book is also physically gorgeous. It is filled with breathtaking natural beauty which enhances the impact of it all. I will read it again and again.

I absolutely loved the Penn Cage series and was hoping Cemetery Road would be as riveting and well written. I’m sorry to say that isn’t the case here. This novel is lacking in intensity, detail, plausibility of plot and character development. The plot isn’t propelled forward by action as much as it is by a story line that is repetitious and predictable. The novels in the Penn Cage series really set the bar high and sadly this book just pales by comparison. I know some people were put off by the political references in the book but even those felt gratuitous and nonessential to the plot. All in all, Cemetery Road was a disappointing read.",3

This is another fantastic, gripping read, as he consistently delivers, and has for several decades. I think those complaining about perceived political biases haven’t been reading his prior books with much comprehension, especially the last trilogy. His books and characters are written with compassion, intelligence, and humanness above all else and complaining about small things is to miss the point and lessen the experience. It’s also very discourteous to Iles, after all that he’s been through and that he still writes books for us to enjoy. And as much as I’d also like another Penn Cage book, I’m not sure I’m emotionally equipped to read one without a few new titles in between... still reeling from the second title in the trilogy, as anyone who’s read it can empthaize with.I found the way Iles brought in a new setting but played with many themes and similarities from his previous titles refreshing and clever.

While we found the characters interesting, there didn't seem to be a plot. Count Rostov is a fascinating although improbable character.

He forms an improbable but delightful relationship with a little girl named Nina who shows him more about the hotel he lives in than he ever knew. Then later Nina drops her daughter Sophia (another little girl) off to stay with him supposedly for only a month. I don't want to give anything away, so I'm not going to tell the story. But the bottom line is that while there is a lot of interesting stuff in this book, I kept wondering what it was all about because there was no goal, no antagonist, no dilemma, no discernible plot.

"88","Milkman: A Novel","An Eccentric Masterpiece","Sheela","1644450003","R1PAX6DQDVGALN","1554889690","The narrator of Anna Burns’ 1918 Man Booker Prize novel Milkman is — what can I say? — like Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett and Luis Bunuel channeled through the voice of a woman who’s exactly the type of person you don’t want to encounter sitting next to you on a plane, train or bus. For the first 20-30 pages, I was convinced there was no way I would be able to finish the book. Then the voice won me over and the book became one of the most intriguing and beguiling, if occasionally taxing, experiences in a lifetime of reading.

This is not a book for the average, casual reader. But anyone whose first love in reading is language and who isn’t confined to conventional narrative and is open to the subversive and transgressive possibilities of literature should have a damned good time with Milkman. What at first seems divorced from reality becomes as real as today’s headlines, the incontrovertible distances between people and peoples, and the deepest philosophical questions, mostly unanswerable, that the human race has through the centuries been provoked to come up with.

I know folks who won’t read contemporary novels, “only classics.” I assume that if they had been alive at the same time as Dickens and Dostoyevski, they would have declined reading either of those writers. I would confidently advise them that this delectably eccentric , hard-to-handle contemporary novel is a masterpiece and probable classic that it would be a shame to miss.

I usually quote generously in reviews, but I fear that quoting anything from this book out of context (to the extent that there is context) might provoke the same recoiling reaction I had during those first 20-30 pages.

Burns concludes the masterly final sentence of her book with “I almost nearly laughed.” A Miss Grundy type of reader might rush to protest that “almost nearly” is redundant. But, no, if you’ve stayed with her to page 348, you know that Burns is in firm command of her language. She knows what she's doing. She didn’t nearly laugh. She ALMOST nearly laughed. The laughter becomes all the more withheld because of the odd locution. Even as she closes her work, Burns once again displays her authentic originality.

This UK book comes to America from Graywolf Press, a not-for-profit publishing house dependent upon grants and donors. The negotiations must have been finalized before Burns won the Man Booker. What a wonderful coup for a small, independent, committed press.",5

Freeman one of my people. Even though I've only met her once, her work has been ushering me along my whole adult life into grace, creativity, and the ordinary Tuesday.
This book is no different. It was an invitation to walk beside into a more soul-aware way of living, in the midst of everyday decisions and not-so-everyday decisions. The Next Right Thing is strewn with grace, peace, soul-care, small-moment attentiveness, helpful advice, true-hearted stories, and sound wisdom, while being completely rooted in faith in the one who made us.
I was so grateful for the way she reassures us over and over again of the steadfastness of God in the midst of our decision making processes and how no matter how it might seem, God ""does not pull rugs out from under you"" and ""he does not drop the other shoe"" (p47). Sometimes it is hard to remember or to know exactly what faith feels like in the midst of hard times, but hearing these words is so freeing.
I also really appreciated how Emily gently guides us back to knowing what we can control and what we can't. Multiple times I found myself underlining sentences like these, because they are so just so helpful to remember:
->""We can't prevent storms from coming, but we can decide not to invent our own."" p79
-> ""We can start down that road of doubt and questioning if we want to. But just because the doubts show up doesn't mean you have to let them sit down."" p138
Each chapter is short and ends with a short prayer and a simple practice for decision making. I want to reread this book soon, a little more slowly this time, just to absorb. It is equally practical and faith-growing.

I figured if I was going to try Stephen King, why not try one that he feels is extreme and his scariest book to date.Upon finishing it, I had mixed feelings, implying pros and cons, and this is a compliment of sorts because going into it, my expectations were still low, for some reason in my gut. The fact that there were pros to go along with the cons showed me the book was better than I expected it to be.What King seems to have going for him is the 'what's going to happen next' aspect of his stories.  The premise is interesting and I really did want to know how the story of the Creed family and nearby Pet Sematary was going to play out. Tasteful decisions, such as the creation of the great character, Jud Crandall, had me in King's corner, so to speak.But, for my money, Pet Sematary, despite the fact it does haunt you when its final page is turned, is too boring.  I don't find King's writing style particularly engaging. He also seems to toy with his readers a bit too much. When something is about to happen, King writes about what the characters think could happen as well as reflections about past incidents in their lives which have not much to do with the current storyline.  This may not be a bad thing if King had more momentum in his writing.  But since his sentences move slowly, the more time he spends on 'what ifs' rather than seeing what's behind that closed door, I feel cheated and a bit irritated. My 395 page volume of Pet Sematary could have been about 275 pages and I would argue it'd be a better book.In the world of differences between being cheesy and corny, King takes his cobs of corn with his boots on and dipped in extra butter whereas I'm standardly set up at the kitchen table, sliding my butter knife deliberately slowly down that thick chunk of cheese.  This could further explain why King may not be entirely for me.",3

"159","Metropolis (A Bernie Gunther Novel)","A well-written goodbye to author and character...","Jill Meyer","0735218897","R23W4JK00M2DQ8","1554897873","British author Philip Kerr died of cancer in March, 2018. He was famous for his Bernie Gunther series and had just published his 13th book in the series. Word was that he had just finished his 14th - ""Metropolis"" - and that it would be ready to print in April 2019. And here it is.

Bernie Gunther was a German soldier on the Eastern Front/a hotel concierge/a ""bull"" cop at the Alex in Berlin/and an in-house cop at Berlin's Adlon Hotel. Those were the ones I can remember right now; Philip Kerr gave his character many professions in many places at many times. (The nice thing about the Bernie Gunther series is that the new reader can dive in at any point in the series and get caught up in Bernie's life quite easily. Since Kerr didn't write the books in any chronological order, there's no need to read them in order, though I do think the new reader should read the three first books in order because they really do shape the character.) Anyway, ""Metropolis"" is a good-bye of sorts to both Philip Kerr and his character.

Set in late 1920's Berlin, the city is teetering on the brink of collapse. The Weimar Republic is not providing good governance, and maybe that's because the city is impossible to govern. Early in the book, Kerr compares 1929 Berlin to the biblical city of Babylon, where evidently, ""anything goes."" I think most people reading this review are familiar with Berlin from Kerr's previous books, and also from other fictional portrayals like ""Cabaret"", though that book by Isherwood took place a few years later.

Kerr begins his book by starting with Bernie in his first days as a new member of the Alex's Murder Squad. He begins by investigating a series of prostitute murders where the victims are scalped. The murderer leaves few clues and the city's residents become obsessed with the idea of a phantom stalking the populace. The murderer has been nicknamed ""Winnitou"" after the main character in Karl May's series of books set in the United States' Old West. The book follows Bernie as he works the case and finds his way around Berlin.

Philip Kerr was a meticulous writer. His characters are finely drawn and he provides both social and historical contexts for his Bernie Gunther series. Bernie, who fictionally died in the mid-1950's, and his creator, who died last year, are leaving the readers who followed his adventures a bit bereft. But all things - and book series - must come to an end.",5

If I have nothing nice or constructively critical to say, I don't say anything. So this is a good review with one snarky comment. I didn't hear the hype about this book; it came across my page because I had just read The Girl in the Ice and The Girl Next Door. The first two lines (and the great intro price) sold me. I one-clicked.The writing was tight, creative turns of phrase, innovative use of verbs... until it got to overkill and pretentiousness rattled the window. When the author's presence intrudes on the immersive story experience, it's not a good thing. So maybe a little too much reaching of new and different ways of saying things (""arrowed looks at each other"" is one that comes to mind although I did enjoy cannon-fire laughter. Good on ya.).That aside, the novel sent me tripping toward a red herring and as a dedicated mystery reader, that's not easy. I guessed many of the parts but not the identity of the killer nor another surprise (where I felt manipulated but still pleased overall). I thought the author was trickily luring us in with Rear Window when all along it was Gaslight, but I was incorrect. That's all I'm saying.The only other thing I have to say is... What happened to the cat? Damn it, all it would have taken is one line, Mr. Finn, but now I have to worry about Punch.My advice? Read this book if you like a good mystery. I'm looking forward to the film. I too love the noir films of the 40s and 50s.",5

I am just so excited for this series, I know I am a bit late to the party but I am glad I finally got there.I had heard great things about Anna Todd and her books were always in the back of my mind well I did it and I would have to say it shot straight to my top 10 books, it made me think about the first books I ever started reading and I loved it so much. The writing style was awesome.What I loved most about this was the angst and always waiting for the penny to drop, Hardin and Tessas relationship was pretty much started from hate and just how explosive they were from the start, just had you turning the pages. I knew there was more to Hardin and I just kept turning the pages to see what was happening.Well to be honest I never expected the ending to be the way it was, I hated it but loved it at the same time. I knew people were hiding stuff from Tessa but I just didn't see it coming and for all her friends to know, I think hit me the hardest.Hardin is a very screwed up character with a past that chips away at him, Tessa tries to break down his walls but he is closed up. I had a huge love hate relationship with Hardin, sometimes I felt sorry for him and sometimes I wanted to punch him the face, all in a good way. His character was frustrating but I wouldn't want it any other way.Tessa was so naive and let's be honest was dazzled by the bad boy, she wanted to be the one to make him a better person but every time she thought it was good bam moody Hardin appeared. I felt sorry for Tessa she tried to be successful if everything she did but Hardin just seemed like a hard guy to love.I felt every sort of emotion through this book, I cried, I laughed, got frustrated, had sympathy, I just wanted to throw my kindle at some points. I could not recommend this book more and I can't wait to get into the rest of the series.Humungas 5 stars for this baby I wish I could give it more but such a fantastic book",5

It is not only scary in the spooky conventional sense, but there are other fears presented that are more human, such as the loss of loved ones and our own fear of dying.  These fears plague us more than fears of ghosts or monsters.With this novel, Stephen King chose to build build more horror through suspense than in the actual events that transpire.  This is clever and keeps you reading.  Then he may jump out and surprise you with something else.  It's a technique used in film.  I'll give you an example:  a woman slowly walks up to a closet, thinking the killer's there.  The music heightens as she slowly opens the door, then stops when it is open and there is nothing there.  There is a sigh of relief, but then, THE KILLER'S BEHIND HER!  King knows how to do this, how to hit us.Why not five stars?

That's what I said when I finished Directorate S. It's a doorstop of a book.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

It's an ambitious attempt, but it is also lazy in its interpretations of it's subtopics. The author lacks a lot of nuance in their conversations about race. The author even goes as far as saying that because certain minority groups are more visible, & hold more ""cultural power"", that it equates to actual power in American society. That idea perpetuated in this book is obtuse and it could have been presented in a way that is more observational than finger wagging.What makes matters worse is that the author writes as if they are American citizen, from an American perspective which is very disingenuous. The Author, Irshad Manji, is a Canadian citizen and Ugandan refugee who should have written from a perspective of being an outsider to American culture. In that way this book is heavily, it does not account for the nuances of American culture or American history especially in race, gender, sexuality, and sexual orientation. It offers up a simplistic view for very complex topics.One final, problem that I have with this book is that the author conflates standing up for oneself, or one's values, or one's right to exist, or hard criticism with bullying. That idea by itself is infuriating as it is insane. There are clear differences between bullying and offering a criticism and the author sadly conflates the two and the book becomes messy.The book offers up an ambitious conversation, but with poor execution and even worse supporting ideas and evidence.",1

"304","The Impossible Climb: Alex Honnold, El Capitan, and the Climbing Life","Great Account of a Superhuman Achievement","M. L Lamendola","1101986646","R3FLNFGJZSU5H7","1554915015","Like Alex's mother, I am a Mensan and an experienced climber. In fact, I run the Mensa Climbing Group in Kansas City. And like Alex (at least in the beginning), I am a gym climber. But unlike Alex, I don't climb 5.14d routes. My maximum is 5.12a, and that's top-roped on a fairly short pitch. He would also smoke me on bouldering problems (V7 is my current max).This book is very well-written, and Mark Synnott clearly understands climbing. He shared some insights that were new for me, and I appreciate that. Synnott seems to take a long time after Chapter One to get to the actual climb up El Capitan or to much about Alex Honnold at all. For most other kinds of books, I would consider this a defect.But this book is different. First, all that prelude is just darn good reading. It also has strategic value in understanding Alex Honnold, especially in relation to other elite climbers. The insight you get into other climbers, including the author, allows you to correctly place Alex in the pantheon of climbers. Without that background, it would be hard for most readers to understand just how spectacular this feat was.Second, I believe the primary audience for this book is climbers. Synnott spends little time explaining climbing, and that's probably a good thing. The book is already long due to all that prelude, no sense in making it tedious too. But isn't the length a problem? I would say not for a climber. A key characteristic of climbing is it is a sport of intense focus and concentration. Another characteristic is it is extremely hard to become proficient in climbing. It takes hundreds of hours of practice to become proficient enough to smoothly send 5.10 routes or V3 problems. Flailing up (and/or across) the wall or muscling your way through the problem does not constitute climbing. It takes dozens or maybe even hundreds more to move from5.10 to 5.11 and from V3 to V4.I see a huge drop-off at V4. Probably only 20% of the people who can consistently send V4 problems can send a V5, and maybe 20% of those can send V6. I climb V7 now, and though I climb at 4 different gyms I know very few people who climb V9 or above. The last time I top-roped, the hardest problem set at that gym was a 5.12a (there were two of them).So if you're writing a book whose target demographic is people who are known for intense concentration and for putting in hundreds of hours to develop their climbing skills, you had better not write a thin puff piece.Now that I have covered what may be a common complaint about this book, let me cover what is the least common complaint about any book. Like the other Mark, I am a professional writer. Who better to judge what other people write? I often cringe at grammatical gaffes, because they are so common. They just don't show up in this book. It seems the other Mark pays as much attention to getting writing right as he does to getting climbing right. As we climbers say when someone does a gnarly move well, ""Nice!""On to some particulars about the book's content.It runs 403 pages (in the pre-release proof copy I have), including the Prologue (a really good read), Author's Note, and Acknowledgements.Sometimes movies are structured with an opening scene in which we see the hero in predicament. Then there's some text that says ""One week ago"" or something like that, and a story unfolds from there. We get back to the opening scene, after which the story picks up where we first came in and the hero solves the dilemma. This book is structured like that. Chapters Two through Five provide an important, and well-told, back story.Part One, ""Youth,"" consists of four chapters. Chapter One is half a dozen pages long, and it sets the stage for the titular free solo climb that is about to happen. Then Chapter Two takes us back to Synnod's beginning as a climber.Part Two, ""The Professional World,"" consists of four chapters. In Chapter Five, we read about the elite climber Alex Lowe and Synnott's adventures with him. We also read about Lowe's death. In Chapter Six, we catch up with Alex Honnold again but we're not picking up where we left off with Chapter One (that will come later). An important dynamic here is Honnold chides Synnott for being too cautious, teasingly calling him ""Mr. Safety.""Part Three, ""Topping Out,"" consists of four chapters. Now that we have gotten to know Alex better via the previous three chapters, we find in Chapter Nine there is serious exploration into how he controls his fear when climbing. This includes a scan of his amygdala, and an analysis of the results. And Part Three includes the final chapter, in which we read about various moments of the historic climb.I found this book deeply entertaining and informative. I hope it inspires more people to take up climbing. The sport has come a long way from its renegade days when Synnott got started. With climbing gyms popping up all over the country, there is plenty of opportunity for people to take up this demanding sport and fit their climbing into a normal life and normal schedule.It isn't necessary to do dangerous climbing to enjoy climbing. The reportable accident rate among USA climbing gyms is 0.07 per 1,000 visitor hours. Compare that to the 2.3 injuries per 1,000 visitor hours of cross-fit gyms. Climbing is almost 3300% safer! In fact, serious accidents in climbing gyms happen less often than falls while hill walking. And of course, climbing is far safer than texting while driving.People have asked me if I'm content to limit myself to gym climbing, and sometimes say, ""Are you going to do real climbing some day?"" In answer, I send them to my YouTube channel (search ""Mark Lamendola climbing) and encourage them to visit a gym and try one of those. Honnold learned climbing at climbing gyms, not because it is fake and easy in those settings but because it is hard and in a controlled environment. Where he took it from there is amazing.New climbers are challenged by a 5.6, breathing hard and finding their arms pumped out after only one climb. That's on a fairly short pitch, maybe 20 or 30 feet. The ceiling for most ""weekend warrior"" climbers seems to be about 5.10b. Climbing several long pitches back to back when they are as hard as 5.14d is superhuman, and that's what I want people to understand about this achievement. It was so far beyond the abilities of most climbers, it's awe-inspiring.Thanks, Mark Synnott, for this book.",5

"306","The Last Stone: A Masterpiece of Criminal Interrogation","Interesting for true crime fans but less so for the regular reader","John D. Cofield","0802147305","RG0DVVSZYDN21","1554915341","I'm a diehard true crime fan so I was thrilled to get my hands on The Last Stone. It starts off interestingly enough: two young sisters go missing in the mid-1970s while at the mall buying pizza. What follows though is a twisted ride through stumped investigations, a fearful community, and one last effort to connect a man with the crime decades later. It's quite a ripe story but unfortunately it falls quite flat from in a narrative sense. It's less so a story and more a recounting of exhaustive interviews between cold case detectives and the suspect Lloyd Welch.

As a true crime fan it was very interesting to see such a real account of the interview process, how completely tiring and repetitive it can be to work a suspect into revealing more than he means to. I also enjoyed the light it shone on the detectives, the toll an investigation like this one takes, and their honest feelings about it all, even in regard to the 'mistakes' made in the process.

However, as a reader, there were long passages which fell flat and boring because of how true the accounting is. I found myself scanning pretty regularly just to get through the parts where again Welch is making excuses and terrible lies. It was very interesting at first but grew dull quickly and I really admire the detectives for being able to work with such person for so long and so thoroughly. I do wish the book had been more narrative in style to keep the reader engaged but I also understand and appreciate the decision for not doing so. I still think true crime fans would really enjoy this book but the casual reader might not find it as engaging.

Note: I received a free Kindle edition of this book via NetGalley in exchange for the honest review above. I would like to thank NetGalley, the publisher Grove Atlantic, and the author Mark Bowden for the opportunity to do so.",4

His book, The Shining is a great horror film.  It takes place in a hotel in the snowy Rocky Mountains.  This story is all about a family that moves to the Overlook  Hotel in the Rocky Mountains.  The family moves so the father can be  isolated and have the time to write.  The kid, Danny has great powers that  he doesn't know about.  In the hotel many terrible and horror things  happen.

"352","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","More twists and turns than Lombard Street","Cathy G. Cole","62678426","R1CQBX5LB444NQ","1554920321","As I began to read The Woman in the Window, the thought ran through my mind that I would drive Anna Fox nuts. You see, I lived next door to a Peeping Tom as I was growing up, so I learned at a very early age to close the curtains once the sun goes down. You want to see something interesting? Move along down the street because you're not going to find it at this house!As I read a little further, another thought crossed my mind. Why am I reading this book when Anna Fox is the type of character I don't like? I have few hot buttons when it comes to reading, but characters who drink to excess is one of them. Anna literally spends her days swilling wine and gobbling pills-- most of which her doctor has told her expressly not to take with alcohol. But I couldn't stop reading. In fact, I found myself reading faster, and I think I know why.A.J. Finn made Anna Fox a compelling, sympathetic, ""train wreck""  of a character. The sort of character that you know something bad is going to happen to, and you just have to keep reading to find out what that bad thing is and if she's going to survive it.The second thing that had my eyeballs glued to the page was the way the story unfolded. Finn does an absolutely marvelous job of weaving old movies like ""Gaslight"" and references to such luminaries as Alfred Hitchcock and Agatha Christie into his story. Moreover, he does it in such a way that the end result's not a slavish imitation but something that keeps the gears whirring in your head while you smile, snuggle down deeper into your chair, and keep on reading.There are two big secrets in The Woman in the Window. How did I do in uncovering them? I figured out one and could kick myself for not deducing the other. If you're in the mood for a story that has more twists and turns than San Francisco's Lombard Street, you really should get your hands on a copy of A.J. Finn's book. It's a good'un.",4

"357","After (The After Series)","Difficult characters to like","Michelle","1982111003","RTNDJHMI9VPUC","1554920966","3-3.5 stars. This story takes place in college, where Theresa (Tessa) Young is starting her freshman year at WCU. Tessa is one of those girls who grew up on the straight and narrow. She earns good grades, follows the rules and is expected to look the part. She even has a boyfriend who fits her profile. Her mom is somewhat controlling and overbearing. So when Tessa meets her roommate Steph and Steph's friends, she's a bit thrown off. They are not the type of crowd that she would normally associate with, nor does her mother approve, but Tessa remains open minded and meets Hardin, too.This story is filled with a lot of drama, angst, highs and lows as well as push and pull. I got a bit of whiplash from the back and forth between Tessa and Hardin. And while this may be typical of college aged characters, there were times where I felt that the dialogue, behavior and actions were even more juvenile than for college. Still, I continued reading to see where this story was going. Tessa and Hardin have this love-hate vibe between them, where Tessa is a bit on the naive side and Hardin is truly a jerk. When he's mad or hurt, he lashes out. As far as the give and take of a relationship goes, Hardin has his limits and I was truly perplexed by him. He's the typical tortured bad boy who doesn't let anyone in and he puts Tessa through the emotional wringer.So while I wasn't particularly captivated by the characters or story, the story did start to pick up when it came to getting to know some of the secondary characters like Hardin's father and Tessa learning more about the real Hardin, as well as seeing Hardin attempting to be the kind of guy deserving of Tessa. And when Hardin finally shares the deeper bits of himself, I began to empathize with him. The ending reveals a zinger of a twist that I didn't see coming, and up until that point, I wasn't sure if I'd continue this series. But now I feel like I need to see what happens next given that it's a game changer and I love that kind of twist.",3

PET is middle of the road King, a not always subtle action-packed chillfest of a man's uncontrolled desire to bring the dead back to life.  Again, the author uses his pen like a magic wane and delivers a nonstop read that deserves all the attention, if only for his always impressing prose.

"395","The Last Stone: A Masterpiece of Criminal Interrogation","The Wheels of Justice","John D. Cofield","0802147305","R3LJRNP5CZMWIF","1554924401","In March 1975 two sisters aged 10 and 12 disappeared from a shopping mall in suburban Maryland. The story was covered intensively over the next weeks, then gradually dropped off the front pages as no suspects and no bodies surfaced. Mark Bowden was a reporter for a Baltimore newspaper in 1975 who covered the story, and it left a lasting imprint on his memory. When, nearly 40 years later, a cold case detective going back over the files made a crucial new discovery, Bowden went back to work, and the result is this chronicle of a crime and its lengthy unraveling.

The Last Stone is a fascinating tale that reveals much about the way investigative detection works. It's a slow, steady, patient process in which the detectives have to restrain themselves and allow their suspect(s) to gradually incriminate themselves. Some of the interviews are repetitive and a bit slow at times, but going through them carefully allows the reader to understand the steps the detectives took to make their case.

By the end of The Last Stone much about what happened to those two little girls in March 1975 has been resolved, though more will forever remain a mystery. I finished the book with renewed appreciation for the dedication and resolve of the men and women who were determined to bring those sisters, and their surviving family, some peace at long last.",4

"406","Greek to Me: Adventures of the Comma Queen","A perfect jewel of a book","Gary K. McCormick","1324001275","R1EQC1A7GT5G4T","1554967259","Part memoir, part travelogue, and part paean to not only the Greek language (ancient and modern), but all things Greek, Mary Norris’s ""Greek To Me"" took me on a memorable voyage through the world of all things Greek, as seen through the eyes of an enthusiastic and well-informed philhellene.

I picked this book thinking that it would be a great introduction, or guide, to the influences of the Greek language on English–and it was, but that is only part of the story. It is also a chronicle of the author’s physical and intellectual journeys into the Greek language, with all its quirks and nuances, and also to Greece itself, and the places which classical Greek literature has made familiar to the world. This book is about understanding Greek, Greeks, and Greece—the language, the culture, both ancient and modern, and the meaning conveyed by an ancient language which no one who lived in the last several centuries had ever heard spoken.

For comprising the underpinnings of much of modern Western literature, the Greek classics are still subject to examination, and speculation as to their meaning, by legions of classical scholars. Ms Norris devotes five-and-a-half pages to an examination of the true meaning of Homer's epithet “gray-eyed Athena”, and the multifarious interpretations that have been applied to the phrase by classicists over the years—and if that sounds boring to you, I challenge you to read that section of the book and come away feeling the same way.

“Greek To Me” is also an examination of the personal journey that Ms Norris was swept up in in the course of her education into Hellenic language and culture. An examination of the legend of Demeter and Persephone leads to insights into her family's loss at the death of her older (by two years) brother Patrick while still a toddler; her experiences as a performer in productions of ""Electra"" and ""The Trojan Women"" lead to epiphanies about her family's dynamics in the wake of her brother's death, her feelings toward her mother, and the effects of and reactions to personal loss.

I realize that the preceding two paragraphs may be seen as casting the book in somewhat dour, academic light, but that is just a failing of my attempts at description. This is a joyful book which lifts the emotions and the intellect. I was happy to come away from my reading with a list of other books to read, including one which I realized, upon investigation, that I already own—Edith Hamilton’s “Mythology”—but which had been relegated to attic storage a couple of decades ago. (Time to get out the ladder.)

I will place this book on the shelf with my other books on language, but with a gold star on the spine, denoting it status as so much more than that, and I will accord it the highest honor that I feel a reader may bestow on a book, which is to re-read it again, and again, until is is dog-eared and tattered, with a multitude of colorful sticky-notes adorning the fore-edge.",5

"416","Pet Sematary: A Novel","A masterpiece of theory from from a master strategist","Jaundiced Eye","198211598X","R1QVKSPY4L50DP","1554967809","An early tank warfare theorist, Liddell Hart championed the cause of mobility in the field and rapid deployment.  Largely ignored by the British, his theories were put into practice by the German High Command, which was influenced by Liddell Hart in their plans for Blitzkrieg in WWII.  It wasn't until the North African Campaign, when O'Connor rolled backed Graziani's ""grey tide"" of Italians by rapid movement, capturing thousands of previously victorious Axis troops, that the British took Liddell Hart seriously enough to put his theories to use on the offensive.  When the Americans arrived, the Allies were ready to face Rommel, who had also steeped himself in Liddell Hart's theories.  The drama of the campaign in central North Africa is, in part, the drama of two sides using different versions of the author's theories.  In ""Strategy,"" we have the thoughts of the mature man, one who has seen that the atomic bomb can stop a rapid deployment in its tracks, and who realizes that the West's military superiority over the rest of the world will end with the proliferation of nuclear weapons.Nuclear weapons are now available to frequent military rivals India and Pakistan (whose ""Islamic Bomb"" secrets were recently transmitted to other Muslim nations by one of the bomb's designers), and to North Korea -- which had fought the West to a bloody standstill in Liddell Hart's lifetime.  The old theories of rapid deployment which were the hallmark of Liddell Hart's earlier thought are STILL believed in by many military leaders, ready, as so often, to fight the LAST war over again.  Liddell Hart's too brief comments about war in the age of nuclear weapons are all the more important to us today, lest we find ourselves caught up in an unwinnable war because of poor strategy.  Liddell Hart's conclusions on ""industrial bombing"" were that it was NOT a useful means of warfare.  We may suggest, based upon very recent military experience, that today's aerial campaign of ""awe and terror"" rapidly lead's to tommorrow's ""guerrila war"" on the ground, down and dirty, and very, very bloody.Liddell Hart's chapter on ""Guerilla War"" helps to illustrate the bloody catastrophes of the Viet Nam era and the current insurgency in Iraq.""Strategy"" is a bit out-of-date, but a wise reader can discern where Liddell Hart's theories WOULD have led had he lived a few years longer.  I rate ""Stragey"" 5 stars, up from my earlier rating of 4 stars, which I gave it before the Iraq ""insurgency"" showed that Basil Liddell Hart knew his stuff:  the war is unfolding as ""Strategy"" suggests that it would.  This book is A MUST READ for anyone interested in strategy, whether for playing war games or waging a real war.",4

Before writing this, I read some of the other reviews. The principal complaint seems to be the perceived ""Trump bashing."" I can't label these readers ""illiterate"", because they are obviously reading an author that I consider to be a high quality writer. And of course I can't know from what part of the country they originate, nor will I make any assumptions about that. However, I would like to ask these readers whether or not they support the ""Double Eagles"" and the ""Poker Club"", because these organizations clearly espouse the policies of the Trump administration. Insider trading, graft, grifting, bribery, threats, and cheating, among others. That is at least part of what ""Cemetary Road"" is all about. Did you miss the point, perhaps?Anyway, I was extremely pleased with ""Cemetary Road."" It was a welcome break from the Penn Cage trilogy, and (so far) is another stand-alone masterpiece by Iles. However, the ending raises the possibility of a sequel, which I would welcome.The story takes place not in Natchez, but in Bienville, which I gather is upstream on the Mississippi. There are flashbacks about Marshall and his brother Adam that are truly engaging, credible, and sad--especially for anyone who has lost a sibling in a similar situation, as I have. There is also the tinderbox relationship between Marshall and Jet in their teens, then Jet with Marshall's best friend Paul, and then the three of them in conflict right up until the end. Lots of suspense and tension there. I was especially moved by the description of combat in Iraq. I can't possibly go into all of the plot details here, but there are many twists and some unexpected turns, as I have grown to expect from Mr. Iles. I was just totally enthralled by this novel and I never wanted it to end, and the quality of the writing is first class. I give this book my highest recommendation and hope to meet Greg Iles someday! What a remarkable man he must be... Thank you, Greg.",5

"429","Cemetery Road: A Novel","Greg Iles Returns to the South","plane","0062824619","R1NXID646Q254U","1554969006","There is one absolute truism in any of Mr. Iles books written about the American south and set in the twentieth century.  There will be a man or woman that is inherently good and facing a group that is evil personified.  Just prior to the present novel he was involved in writing several books centered in the city of Natchez. His principal character became involved with fighting a group calling itself the ""Double Eagles"".  The story actually painted the villains as being involved with both the assassination of John F. Kennedy as well as running Natchez.Cemetery Road introduces Marshall McEwan in the role of principal protagonist and a shadow group known as the ""Poker Club."" Marshall grew up in the small town of Bienville, Mississippi.  He was an athlete, a good student and in love with a girl nicknamed Jet.  Jet seemed to reciprocate this love until circumstances drove them apart.  Marshall left his birthplace, went to Washington, D.C. and over eighteen years gained a well earned reputation as a great reporter.  He found himself in many dangerous areas and it appeared that he would continue.  His work won him a Pulitzer prize capping his already great reputation.His progress was interrupted by his mother calling him to return to Bienville to run the family newspaper.  His father who was the editor in chief had suffered a major coronary and Marshall was asked to keep things moving until his father recuperated. The biggest problem for Marshall was that he ran into his old girl friend Jet.  She was married to Paul, a boyhood friend of his, but it looked like she and Marshall were  still in love with each other.  While they planned to leave together when Marshall was free to return to his Journalistic career Jet was hampered by Kevin, her son, and the obvious fact that her husband would never let him leave with his mother.The circumstances of the novel include the winning of the construction of a big Paper mill by the Chinese government In Bienville and the prospect of more jobs, higher wages and added fortunes for members of the Poker Club.  A murder of a man that found ancient bones and works at the proposed site of the Paper Mill with the prospect of the town losing the site and the Mill galvanizes  the actions of both Marshall and the Poker Club in different points of view.  Marshall to expose the murder and the club to protect their turf.Mr Iles is a superb builder of characters for his novels and Cemetery Road is no exception.  How will the affair between Marshall and Jet turn  out?  And, of course will the Poker club succeed in keeping the knowledge of a probable historic site from the U.S. government and the turning of it into a protected national park.  Like his previous novels centered on Natchez this one is possibly the first of more.  But it stands alone as a completely mesmerizing read with the questions raised by the ending not spoiling the enjoyment of a great author at his best.",5

Millicent and and her husband --never did find a name for him -- have two children, Rory and Jenna. They live in an upscale subdivision, Hidden Oaks, in Woodview, Florida. They do all the things that a family does: both work (he's a tennis pro at the club giving private lessons and she's a realtor), cook, clean, chauffeur the kids to and from their sporting events and oh yes, they like to abduct and murder women. It's really a tag team sort of thing for them, and they are quite good at it. But, as these things often do, it all goes haywire. NO SPOILERS. You'll just have to read this one for yourself.

Was this an engaging story? Definitely. I promise you'll be so riveted that you won't come up for air until you've reached the epilogue. Is it believable? Well, that's a hard one, but I'm saying not exactly. But definitely a thrill ride from start to finish even if I didn't really like how it ended. The couple is definitely one that you wouldn't want in your close circle of friends. Both are despicable people and I guarantee you will find it hard to have any positive feelings about their behavior. It's not a perfect book but it is one heck of a story so start reading already. I'm sure it's bound for the big screen or a miniseries at some point and it will be hyped a bunch after publication.

I recommend his Penn Cage series to anyone that will listen, especially those that live in the South. A good friend recently said, “Being a Southerner and have not read Iles is like not having read Grisham.” And it’s true! The way that Iles writes the South is unlike any other and captures the essence of the South so beautifully.In his first stand-alone since his Penn Cage Trilogy (Natchez Burning, The Bone Tree, and Mississippi Blood) which focuses around civil rights, Cemetery Road tells a story of life in a small struggling town, political corruptness, and a forbidden love triangle.In one of the best opening chapters in literary history, we’re introduced to Marshall who “never meant to kill [his] brother.” Like most Southern men, at some point we find ourselves coming home to take care of our families. He has withdrawn from a very successful Washington DC reporting career to help his ailing and estranged father keep his small Mississippi town newspaper afloat.Shortly after his arrival Buck, a father-figure to Marshall is found floating in the Mississippi River. His wounds aren’t consistent with a fall or drowning and Marshall begins to find that perhaps some people of the community thought Buck was sticking his nose too far where it didn’t belong, potentially jeopardizing a business development that would be detrimental to the town’s success.In typical Iles fashion, the writing is phenomenal and the plot is full of twists and suspense that keeps you flying through the pages.",5

The answer is CEMETERY ROAD, a riveting stand-alone about a prodigal son called home because of an ailing parent, and who winds up in the middle of a murderous maelstrom.  [Sidebar: there's a scene late in this book that's sure to leave almost any adult with aging parents in tears.]  It's fabulous--less ""issue-driven"" than the Natchez books, and so a little more accessible, overall.

I never set out to hate my father. I never dreamed I would bury my own son. Nor could I have imagined that I would betray the childhood friend who saved my life, or win a Pulitzer Prize for telling a lie. All these things I have done, yet most people I know would call me an honorable man."" openingMarshall McEwan has returned to his hometown of Bienville, Mississippi, because his father is dying. Marshall swore he'd never return when he left at eighteen, but his mother needs his help. His father is terminally ill, and the 150-year-old family owned newspaper, The Watchman, is struggling. He also knows that his first love, Jet, who is married to his best friend, Paul, will be in Bienville. Marshall begins his story when Buck McKibben, the scoutmaster who was a surrogate father to him after his father ignored him, is murdered.But Marshall, who is an accomplished investigative journalist, begins to look into the murder and the role that the Poker Club could have played in it. The Poker Club is a group of wealthy  good old boy patriarchs who rule the town and control it behind the scenes. They have been running the town as long as The Watchman has been around. Now they have managed to land a deal for a billion-dollar Chinese paper mill to come to town and start an economic upturn for the town. It seems that Buck's death may have been tied to a discovery that would stop that from happening.""To understand this story, you must swim between two times like a person moving from wakefulness to sleep and then back again."" The story requires the disclosure of background information from years ago that affects the present day machinations. The narrative is a tangled tale that includes the death of brothers and sons, friendship, first loves, war, dysfunctional families, secrets, betrayals, corruption, and the power of wealth.Iles has penned another excellent, engrossing, spellbinding novel that will seize your attention, induce many diverse emotions, and not let up until the ending. I was completely immersed in the narrative from start to finish and the pages flew by as I compulsively read ""just one more chapter."" This is a long book, but it doesn't feel overly long. The plot is intricate and complicated on several different levels.  The setting is well-developed and the characters are fully realized. You may find yourself talking back to Marshall, telling him to use his brain, as he makes some decisions that you (and he) know are mistakes.The quality of the writing, though, is what sets Iles apart and makes this exceptional novel one of the best I have read this year. It has been awhile since I simply had to save quotes from a novel, and I have pages full of them from Cemetery Road. For those paying attention, there is a plethora of wisdom and universal truths found in Iles writing.Disclosure: My review copy was courtesy of HarperCollins.",5

Add more on top of it, a man who was like a Father to him has been murdered and Marshall is looking to discover who did it, his love of his life is married to his best friend who happened to save his life...now I could go on and on.

Iles is a great story teller and he comes through strong in this novel!  I read ""Natches Burning"" and was so impressed with how he weaved in political historical facts in a fictional story; it read so believable that I decided to read this novel.  Just as in his earlier novels he includes today's sentiments towards politics and political figures, which will offend some readers who can't read objectively.  The story line at times felt it pulled in concepts from ""Natches Burning"" which is my reason for a 4 star rating.  Full of suspense, betrayal, wealth and power, and the corruption that consumes the arrogant... it will make you put today's political abuse in perspective.",4

"479","Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault: Essays from the Grown-up Years","Oh, How I can Relate","Monnie Ryan","0735218420","R38CBYF9J4SHVX","1554976959","I'm not sure which I did more of while reading this wonderful book: chuckle out loud or wipe away tears. It helps, I suppose, that I was a huge fan of the author's long-running ""Cathy"" comic strip. Perhaps more important, while I'm older than she is by nine years, I, too, was a champion of the feminist movement (still am, as is she) and was for a time sandwiched in between parents and a daughter, all of whom were growing old, and up, way too fast. Sadly, my parents are gone now - and my daughter has become the ""stuff"" inside the Oreo of life, caught between a grown daughter of her own and her aging parents (which, Lord help us, means me and my husband).

In any event, oh, how I can relate - and I'm quite sure all but teenybopper females will do so as well. These essays were written, Guisewite says, at a time when she's trying to ""declutter"" her own life (hmmm, I'm pretty sure that's a word that passed through our daughter's lips last time she popped in for a visit). Feminist though she may be, Guisewite admits to feeling torn between Betty Crocker and Betty Friedan (conjuring up decades-ago memories of whipping up a casserole for my family to eat while I attended a Gloria Steinem lecture). I choked with laughter - and frustration - as she recounted getting ""stuck"" in a sports bra; as a gym newbie, I can tell you it's not fun (though worse, perhaps, is the embarrassment over having to call someone to your rescue). And before I caved and joined the gym, I, too, resisted the call to exercise, rationalizing that ""I exercised yesterday and I don't look any different.""

There are far too many other shared feelings and experiences to mention here (especially since I don't want to spoil the fun for other readers). In the end, she sums up the dilemma we're in perfectly: ""My whole generation is reeling from the stunning truth - that we, who are way too young and hip to ever look or act old, are not too young to pass away."" Aha - maybe that's why I glance proudly at the year-old Aristocat tattoo on the top of my flip-flop clad foot as I open the morning newspaper first to the obituaries pages. Torn indeed!

In short, I love, love, love this book - highly recommended. Many thanks to the publisher, via NetGalley, for the opportunity to read and review an advance copy.",5

I have been a dedicated Iles fan for years. I adore his early books and read them over and over.Sadly, I had started noticing with the most recent trilogy that his writing was beginning to be very bloated. Additionally, Greg was falling victim to feeling his role is to be a moral authority. I miss the old days when his books were an intelligent escape. I loved reading them and saying to myself “Didn’t see THAT coming.”  Now they are increasingly preachy and drawn out.After reading the reviews, I plan on saving my time and money on this one.  While the addition of politics into this book may have been an attempt to keep it timely and relevant, it really makes it dated. Many Iles fans reread his books over and over years after they have been written. Not sure the politics of this time will hold up as a good read in 10 years.Please, Greg, bring back the timeless. totally engrossing thrillers with unexpected plot twists we used to know.

Stephen King is an author who has written many horror stories such as It and so on. He has also written books in other genres such as action and science fiction. An example would be The Gunslinger, but he is known mainly for horror stories.Louis and his family had just recently moved to Maine from Chicago. Louis and his family meet Jud Crandall who helps pull a stinger out of Gages neck. The house they moves to is near a large road which trucks go by a lot. They find a cemetery near their house with a sign that misspells cemetery. Gage is taught how to fly a kite and while they’re not paying attention something horrible happens.When writing this book Stephen King wrote this to show that playing god is a bad idea and that the actions you take will lead to consequences. The lesson was don’t try to fix what has been done and move on. When Louis buries Church the cat comes back alive but stinks, and hates him.I think this is a great book, I enjoyed reading it despite the amount of language. I think that Stephen King could have improved it by making his books for teenager friendly. Otherwise it would be nice if he didn’t use so much language.I would recommend Pet Sematary to teenagers and adults that are mature. The book being in the horror genre means it will have gore, blood, and profanity. If you are not ok with those things, this is not a book for you.",4

A beautifully written novel that provides insights into the changes taking place in Russia in the first half of the twentieth century. It at once showcases the ideals of the Russian revolution together with nostalgia for the loss of tradition and culture of the Tsarist era. It contrasts the evolving political cultures of the West versus their Soviet counterparts - highlighting important issues such as gender equality, efficiency, and economic planning, while at the same time, illustrating how the regime established for the collective good erased all measure of the importance of the individual. This is all wrapped up in a winding tale of a charming old gentleman and his love for the finest things in life. A treat for anyone who demands to learn while they are entertained!",5

The author may reference briefly the political climate, which seems fitting considering the 24/7 news cycle we live in and the division that many of us see and feel within the country and often our own families.

There is still a very weak hypothesis about why someone trying to grow for 1,3, or 20 years suddenly has an experience after 20 years vs. reliably day by day. This weak point, combined with a concentration of a few miraculous events over time in a group sampling of tens of thousands can create a blind spot:a) There is and always has been a small statistical amount of miraculous human experiences.b) What is much less clear is where and why these are concentrated. If you have 10,000 people all going to a workshop for healing, some of them would have had miraculous experiences in any context, some in one meditation practice, and some in another.c) What is lacking is a statistical sampling that scientifically records: 10,000 people all did the workshop (since all the miraculous things mentioned seem to occur in Joe's workshops) and each one wanted X miracle to occur. Of those 10,000 people how many got it in one workshop, how many in two or three workshops and how many never got their miracle. I think this is important in assessing the paradigm as a treatment, and then compare this with 10,000 people who wanted a miracle and did their own thing over the same amount of time.This experiment would allow someone considering Joe's protocols to say: There is a 4% chance that if I spend $15,000. on airfare and the like that I will have a miraculous experience. Or it's 6% - whatever the number. The next step is to continue to refine distinctions in who did/did not create a miracle based on objective data about thoughts, habits etc.",4

This is pantheism in a thin coat of Christianity. John 1 most clearly argues that Jesus is alone in being the Christ, and several places in the Gospels, Jesus warns about false Christ’s (Luke 21:8, Mark 13:6-22, and Matthew 24:5-26) He also calls Himself the Christ (The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.” Jesus said to her, “I who speak to you am he.”John 4:25-26) and never at anypoint does the Bible make refrence to a Christ Force if you will. Rohr also believes that the death of Jesus was not an atoning sacrafice for the sin ofMan even though there are many verses clearly stating that His death on the cross was for the atonement of mankind (2 Corinthians 5:21, 1 Peter 1:18-21, Acts 20:28, Colossians 1:18-23, Ephesians 1:3-14, Hebrews 9:11-28, the whole chapter of Hebrews 10, 1 John 1:5-10, Luke 22:20, the whole chapter of Romans 5, Romans 3:21-31, Revealtion 1:5-7, Revelation 7:13-17, Revelation 12:10-12, and Jesus Himself declared it to be so in Matthew 26:26-29)",1

"581","Cemetery Road: A Novel","All absorbing- one of the best crime fiction books of the year!","Larry","0062824619","R2VTCY8E66WCH","1554987666","Marshall McEwan is a successful reporter working in Washington DC. He is in print and he is on TV. He has even won a Pulitzer prize for war reporting. Now he must return to Bienville, the small Mississippi town he is from as his father is terminally ill and he must tend to the business of running the family newspaper. When a man, who was his surrogate father is found murdered in the river, Marshall begins to look into the death. This leads him into a confrontation with the Poker Club, a group of powerful local businessmen who will apparently stop at nothing to get their way- including murder. To add to the complexity, Marshall begins to carry on an affair with Jet Matheson, the wife of his best friend from childhood.  It is obvious that no good can come from this.CEMETERY ROAD is another epic novel written in the same style as the NATCHEZ BURNING trilogy. Greg Iles creates a profoundly realistic setting from which to set his unique cast of characters. The author is brilliant at juxtaposing various storylines into each other from the present and the past. The traditions and secrets of a small Southern town come vividly to life. The plot is compelling, and the pages do move rapidly to the inevitable but satisfying conclusion. One point of criticism is the excessive expository dialogue near the end. So much of it seems unnecessary and given the extreme length of the book, there was plenty of room to divulge some of this material earlier.  It is still another great read by this incredibly prolific author. NOTE- there is considerable discussion about the politics in the book. Personally, I found it annoying but there is so much more to this book that the politics really play no role whatsoever in the actual story. Highly recommended- one of the best of the year.",5

We are there in a rock story, and we hear the truth,with no filters, from the people involved. Daisy Jones, born into money in LA, Hollywood Hills, to parents who had little or no interest in her. She had no love, no attention and found her way on the Sunset Strip. Living the life with the groupies, drug, sex and rock and roll. She was a beauty and found she had a voice,started writing her own songs, found others with the same instinct. She is a young woman with a complicated life, looking for the man she can’t have. Billy Dunne, a young man with a woman who adores him, a love of music, addicted to drugs and rock and roll, and fits perfectly into the Daisy Jones and The Six.We all know what a great rock and roll band looks like from the outside, and now, we find out what it is like to live it. Some of the story line seems to be based loosely on Stevie Nicks because this is the story of a strong woman and her band. The writing is sometimes pretty raw but true. The storyline is so intoxicating, Daisy is everything I ever wanted to be, Billy the man everyone wants, addicted but in love with his woman, Camila; Karen the keyboardist, and Simone the outlaw the disco queen. All of the band members with their own stories, and we are with them, part of the band. And, then.....The Night They Drove Ole Daisy Down.Recommended. prisrob 03-05-19",5

It's a tour de force that still scares the bejezus out of everyone who reads it.The Torrance family are trapped in The Overlook Hotel for winter. For most of us that would mean long boring periods of watching movies on cable TV. For them, it's hell.Danny has a psychic power which somehow increases the intrinsic evil of the hotel itself. And caught between them is his father, Jack.As an unsuccessful alcoholic writer, Jack is like a self-portrait of an alternative version of the author himself (and I was astounded to read in his much later book On Writing that King himself claims he did not realize this until many years later). As the weakest of the three, he's the one the hotel takes over.And much of the power of this is that Jack is at heart a good man. Weak, but good. He took the job to help his family, to try to keep himself away from booze and solve his anger management issues. That he's trapped and subverted by an evil hotel is a tragedy.So this novel has both irony and compassion for all three members of the family.Within ten years King would go over to the side of political correctness. If he wrote this novel today, Jack would have no humanity or redeeming qualities. His wife would kill him to protect Danny and we'd wonder why they ever got married to begin with.",5

Both books portray incredibly strong women, at the center of which are two generations of real life heroines, all of whom overcome incredible challenges and heartbreaks.

"685","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Good, but something's missing","Chet L. Young","198211598X","R1M69KHHECZMZE","1554999599","*Spoilers Ahead*""The Shining"" is not my favorite among Stephen King's early novels; I thought ""Carrie"" was much more interesting as a character study, and ""'Salem's Lot"" was more frightening. Of course, that doesn't mean ""The Shining"" is a bad book. It isn't. Overall it succeeds as entertainment and holds up pretty well to a second reading.So what's the problem? After establishing the characters, King gets off to an excellent start by giving the reader a glimpse of the Overlook Hotel's troubled history--but then, frustratingly, abandons this promising path in favor of increasingly clunky descriptions of the hotel's possessed topiary (the hedge lions just didn't work for me, no matter how laboriously King wrote about them) and Jack Torrance's psychosis. I would have welcomed a bit more detail about the shady dealings of Horace Derwent and his Mafia associates. Nonetheless, the book does conjure some genuine scares--especially in the passages about the dead woman who inhabits Room 217.As I've said, I prefer ""Carrie"" and ""'Salem's Lot"", but if you're a fan of Stephen King in general (and of his early work in particular) you'll naturally want to own ""The Shining"", too. Personally, I found it underwhelming and feel that King went on to write a much more engaging and nearly perfect horror novel with ""Pet Sematary"".",3

It looked amazing and I knew I had to dive into this series. I'm glad I did. I bought the audible which was another great purchase.  The narrator did amazing.This is the tough part for me.  I hate spoilers so I'm trying my hardest not to spoil anything but I need to voice my opinion.  Here it goes....I do love Tessa's character besides what she does to her 1st boyfriend.  She is in collage now living own her own in a dorm room.  She really tries to not to judge her new roommate Steph and her rugged tattooed guy friends. She really does try hard to fit in even though she is completely opposite to these people. Harden what's there not to love? He is tall dark tattooed piercings, and downright rude! He has bad past, but you will see the good qualities he does have, and it will definitely make any girl swoon.The characters drove me mad with all the drama ( in a good way) it was very entertaining, but highly annoying.  What Tessa did to Noah was completely uncalled for, and what Harden did was even worse BUT that's what she gets for playing dirty as well. That's how I look at it. I was shocked at the last couple of chapters.  My mind was blown, but I didn't really feel much hatred towards Harden for his actions. Usually I would be mad, but I see a huge redeeming quality in both characters, more so on Harden's part. I just can't stay mad at the dude like poor Tessa.

At the age of 14 I began to really watch it and start to enjoy it rather than cover my eyes most of the time.  For years I constantly heard gripe from people who had read the book and said it was so much better than Kubrick's version, so I grew more and more curious.I finally received it as a Christmas present in 2005.  It is by far the best book I've ever read.  Technically, the story is better than Kubrick's version because it goes deeper into the character of Jack Torrance(but I hold each version as a different story all together.  I still find Kubrick's version more enjoyable).My first reading of it was fantastic, and after I was done reading it and thought about what I just read, I was a little frightened at times.

"703","Run Away","Page by page gripping action","MKS","1538748460","R2M8B3T4Z384Q8","1555000846","Harlan Coben is a renowned thriller author, and his latest novel is literally page by page gripping action. The pace never falters and just when you think you can catch your breath, another twist has your mind off and running again. The layers of plot are truly captivating, and the level of detail and unpredictable surprises is impressive and wholly believable.

Simon Greene sits in Strawberry Fields in Central Park, watching this bedraggled homeless girl, playing and singing for money and butchering a version of the Beatles song, Penny Lane. Simon is a high-end financial advisor and his wife, Ingrid, is a paediatrician, both wealthy, happily married and supportive of their 3 children, yet here he watches his run-away daughter Paige. Her hair matted and her cheekbones sunken. She was rail-thin, raggedy, dirty, damaged, lost and a drug addict. He has searched a long time to find her and his heart breaks as he watches his beautiful daughter in such a decrepit and pitiful state.

When Simon approaches her, he is confronted by her drug dealer boyfriend, Aaron. After an altercation between Simon and Aaron, Paige takes off and goes back into hiding. Several days later Aaron is found savagely murdered, and of course who is the main suspect? Simon needs a high priced and capable lawyer to help his case and the interplay between lawyer and law enforcement is absorbing and quite revealing.

On a separate thread, several targeted murders are taking place by a professional killer. Simon and Ingrid are trying to find their daughter. A private investigator, Elena Ramirez, is trying to find a missing person and a Detective Fagbenle is investigating a murder and searching for a killer or killers. It’s unfair to say anything more about the story as it reveals itself so cleverly that the turns and surprises shock the reader - regularly.

The dialogue, imagery, characterisation and plot, weave together so effortlessly that it is a delightful experience to read this book. The family challenges are wonderfully portrayed and what will happen the ideal family when placed under extreme pressure. What family secrets will be exposed in an effort to understand what happened their daughter? What pressures are put under children as they start to live independent lives while having been protected their whole youth? An amazing book with so many perspectives to explore a story. Themes that are appropriate in today’s world make this a contemporary novel that just frightens the life out of me.

Run Away is a masterful story delivered by a true master of the mystery thriller. A book that I highly recommend and a solid 5 star. I'd like to thank Grand Central Publishing and NetGalley for providing me with an ARC version in return for an honest review.",4

"745","Run Away","Plot twists galore, family drama, and mystery","MKS","1538748460","RIX9CFE4D447L","1555004113","Simon believes that he and his wife, Ingrid, a pediatrician, have established a nearly perfect life. They have 3 beautiful children, successful careers, a beautiful home in Manhattan.

And then their oldest daughter, Paige, goes away to college . . . and it all goes wrong. Paige becomes a drug addict, drops out of school, and has an abusive boyfriend, 11 years her senior. After all attempts to help her fail, she disappears.

Brokenhearted, Simon cannot bring himself to stop searching for her, even though he and Ingrid have agreed to suspend their efforts. With a tip and some luck, he spots her playing the guitar and singing at Strawberry Fields in Central Park. But she's clearly strung out to the point of being nearly unrecognizable. And when Simon approaches her, begging her to come home with him, her boyfriend, Aaron, materializes and there is an altercation. In the chaos, Paige runs.

Three months later, Aaron has been brutally murdered and Paige may be in danger. Simon and Ingrid are now united in their effort to find Paige, and together they venture into a dangerous world. With tragic consequences.

Meanwhile, former FBI agent and private investigator Elena Ramirez has been hired to find a missing 24-year-old. Henry Thorpe's wealthy father is not convinced that the text he received from his son saying he was heading west for a couple of weeks means Henry is not in trouble. Just the opposite, in fact.

And Ash has been hired to kill two men. He doesn't ask questions. He simply carries out his assignments, accompanied by his friend, DeeDee, with whom he was in foster care as a youth. DeeDee has joined a cult, the Shining Truth, and is known as Holly at its compound, Truth Haven.

At the outset, how these three disparate stories are related is a mystery. But as bestselling author Harlen Coben's intricately plotted new thriller, Run Away, progresses, it becomes clear that there will be convergence. First, Elena and Simon encounter and begin working together to find Paige. Both are empathetic characters. Elena has lost the love of her life and been forced to leave the FBI following an injury that left her with a limp. Simon is forced, through Paige's disappearance and other events, to confront his effectiveness as a father and husband. His introspection fuels his determination to make amends for mistakes he made -- even though he thought he was doing his best at the time -- and be more present if only he can find Paige and set things right in his family. Along the way, he finds a surprising ally, as well as a few enemies who threaten not only his well-being, but that of his family.

Run Away's pace never slackens as Coben takes readers along on Simon's desperate search to find his daughter and keep her safe, and keeps them guessing about how the three seemingly unrelated stories are, in fact, connected. As they begin to converge, Coben reveals plot twists and surprising developments that propel the story forward. And just for good measure, he wraps the story up with a jaw-dropping conclusion.

Run Away is a compelling exploration of just how far a father and mother will go to protect their children. But it is also a surprisingly tender exploration of marriage and relationships that illustrates it is impossible to ever fully know another person. Everyone harbors secrets. Coben explores how one family deals with secrets that are finally exposed, as well as whether some secrets can remain hidden for the sake of the family's survival. Run Away is a contemporary, intriguing story with endearing, relatable characters that will leave readers pondering its themes long after they've finished reading the book.

"747","After (The After Series)","Great story, if you can over look poor editing...","S. Jacobsen","1982111003","R1J7OZKHDAS6FD","1555004151","**SPOILERS** this is basically a review of the whole series. I binge read the entire thing so it feels easier to just talk about it all.I saw a trailer for the movie coming out and thought it looked intriguing, so when I heard it was a book series I naturally thought I’d give it a try. I had heard nothing about this series whatsoever so I had absolutely no expectations going in.I spent the last 5 days reading the whole series. After finishing the first book I was sucked into the crazy world that is Tessa and Hardin.Honestly I think the story itself was fascinating, it was unique love story for sure. Tessa and Hardin’s relationship was tumultuous, it was like a train wreck I just couldn’t look away from. At times I didn’t know whether I was rooting for them or praying Tessa would come to her senses. They are in a very toxic and abusive relationship. (I hope younger readers do not think that how Hardin treats Tessa would be at all an acceptable way to be treated. I personally would not let my teenage daughter read this.)The story really does pull you in though, I felt like I was emotionally invested in these characters lives and had to see it through to the end.  I definitely cried on several occasions reading this. You really feel for the characters and what they’re going through. I found myself thinking about the characters even when I wasn’t reading. I had a hard time putting my kindle down.If you like dramatic story lines, this series is filled with them, maybe too many.  Poor Tessa and Hardin just could not catch a break, I was honestly surprised they both survived to the end.The main problem with the entire series is the poor editing. Did no one edit this book?? I get that it started online and was written on an iPhone... but come on did no one from Simon and Schuster want to edit it before it was officially published?? I lost track of how many typos and misused words I came across. Just way too many!! I found it distracting.  Another thing that annoyed me was when two characters would be having dialogue , one would ask a question or make some remark, then you’d get a big explanation of what that character was doing or maybe some inner dialogue, by the time the second character replied (sometimes even on the next page) I couldn’t even remember the original comment/question and had to go back.  Sometimes sentences were strangely worded. And the dialogue felt a bit unnatural at times ( always using “you are” or “I am” instead of how people actually talk saying “you’re” and “I’m”).All in all I did throughly enjoy the story. And I was happy they got their happy ending... eventually (I did hate how it took so long for them to finally be together and be happy, I would have liked to have had more of that story) It just needed some major editing help.",4

I also think it changed the way I interact with people since the Count had to entertain himself through conversation.This book was read as part of my book club and the group talked about it for four straight months.  We then had a dinner party to recreate some of the dishes served to the Count in the story.  Super fun.  Truly, my favorite book I’ve read in years.",5

This book is now ranked in my top 10 and I honestly want to already read it again. Daisy Jones and The Six is beautiful tale of the rock and roll in the 70s. With fabulous characters and scences from that era, Daisy Jones and The Six is an emotional rollcoaster.Written as an ongoing interview, it tells the story of Daisy Jones and the band The Six working, making it in the rock and roll industry and the peril that goes with fame and fortune. This book sucks you in and doesn't let you go even after you have read the last word. Filled with laughs, tears and much, much more, Daisy Jones and The Six will leave you wishing this was a true story and you could really experience this band.Taylor Jenkins Reid's masterful storytelling honestly is what gives this book its magical powers. I found myself up late at night because I did not want to stop reading. She has a great sense of what the rock and roll scene was in the 70s. She makes you feel like you are there, witnessing it all first hand. Also, kudos Ms. Reid for the punch in the gut reveal that still has me reeling. My husband literally stopped what he was doing to ask if I were okay because the tears would not stop.It has been a long time since I have wanted to shout and demand everyone read a particular book. However, if you read no other book in 2019, make sure you Daisy Jones and The Six is the one you read!!!",5

The ""grilled leaks"" would definitely be better, after they're boiled, to be placed cut-side up, under the broiler, rather than fried in a pan. Considering the had been boiled, pan frying leaves them slightly mushy.

Also, I found the ""Argonian swamp shrimp boil"" to be a little heavy with the soy sauce. I'd personally use about half the recipe instructed amount.

Michael Nace","078522954X","R2DSH8D0VXCAGY","1555009120","For those familiar with Dr Jeremiah there will be a lot of familiar material here. As I read the book I recalled many of the discussions here from previous books or programs. The book begins rather lightweight but by the time you get to chapter 8 the book ramps up to more serious and meaty material. This is classic Jeremiah: stories, illustrations, news items and stats, nothing too controversial or edgy, politically correct theologically speaking all to illustrate his views. David comes from a literal viewpoint from his Dallas seminary theology so you will see him believing Babylon will be rebuilt as a real city down the road one day as a world commerce center. Dr. Henry Morris espoused the same theology in his Henry Morris Study Bible. Glaringly missing were comments on the ecumenical movement and tensions within the Church worldwide which for me hold phenomenal prophetic significance. But that is beside the point. This book will go down as David's magnum opus at nearly 500 pages, some or much of which was gleaned from previous material as mentioned earlier you will see if familiar with his ministry. But for those looking for a current treatment of Biblical prophecy by news headlines and world events happening now, and for those new to Dr. Jeremiah, it is good for a one volume treatment from a literal Biblical interpretation of current events and as a primer in evangelical theology.",5

If you have ever worked under these practices then you might know the flaws but many do not.

This stuff is priceless.  You know doctors don't get paid to read research and learn about this stuff, and that's why most don't bother, and most don't know.

"897","Pet Sematary: A Novel","One of King's best","David L. Allen","198211598X","R1O9SJTLB4OXCQ","1555056408","I have read most of King's books and though I am a sucker for his epics (It, The Stand), I would have to rate this as one of his best.  However, Pet Sematary is not scary in the traditional sense, it is more of a descent into madness and despair, as a father tries to deal with the loss of his son.  To me, the best parts of this book are the following:  (1) How King captures the elation AND frustration of parenthood--how you want to toss your kids out the window one minute and then squeeze them with love the next. The part where Louis Creed flies a kite with his son Gage (before the horrible stuff starts happening) is one of the best descriptions I've ever read of the wonder and joy of having kids.  (2) Similarly, how King evokes the absolute devastation of having a child die.  His description of Louis Creed's shattered psyche following the accidental death of his son is so vivid and realistic that I defy anyone with kids to read it and not be crushed too.  (3) Finally, the way that King draws us along Louis Creed's ever-deepening path of desperation and insanity as he contemplates the unthinkable--trying to bring his son back to life--is outstanding.  Often in horror books or movies we find ourselves asking, ""Why did that character do that, or go in there, or whatever??"", but here King makes Louis Creed's journey from grief to insanity very, very believable.  If faced with such a choice, how many of us would do what Louis did?  Probably a lot of us.",5

"1016","Exceptional You!: 7 Ways to Live Encouraged, Empowered, and Intentional","One of my favorites...","Orsayor Simmons","1546010629","R1E03NY04W20CQ","1555065313","Exceptional You by Victoria Osteen is easily one of my favorite books of 2019. I love reading inspirational books, but this one resonated with me from beginning to end. Maybe it's because of the things I have been experiencing in my life lately that made me hold on tightly to Victoria's words of encouragement. The title implies that there are seven ways to live encouraged, empowered, and intentional, but I feel as though Victoria gives the readers more than seven ways to live your best life.

The reason I feel as though she gives more than seven ways is each of the seven core principles is broken down with two main points. Let me not forget about the Exceptional Thoughts section!! The Exceptional Thoughts section opens up discussion amongst each other or yourself. I would recommend getting yourself a journal and write out how you can apply these principles to your life.

Victoria Osteen also shares stories of people who are now living their exceptional life. That's one of the things I love about Victoria; she has the gift of storytelling. One of the stories she shared was a story of her friend that owns IT Cosmetics. It's always a fantastic thing to hear about the backstory of someone's success. It serves as a reminder that things don't ever happen overnight. We have to be persistent, faithful, and never give up on our dreams! God may not come when we want him to, but HE is still on time.

I also recommend that everyone get themselves a Memory Box and hold on close to it. You will have to read the book to find out what I'm referring to, but I believe it's one of the most powerful thing you can do for yourself.

I highly recommend you buy this book for yourself! It's time for us to start embracing what makes us Exceptional!!",5

The lessons Dave learned from Lucy aren’t going to surprise anyone. The author himself admits that these are obvious, common sense lessons we all know already. But as he says, we often do a lousy job of using what we know. If reading this encourages you to implement some of these lessons more consistently, I’m sure you will start to feel happier.

This is even somewhat educational. I will never look at scallops the same again!

I highly recommend this book to anyone with a heart and a sense of humor.

I rarely give 5 stars to a book and frankly the amount of trash that I have read over the past two years in this genre thrillers, detective stories this was gold to my mind. When do you ever find literature in a modern day thriller, murder story. There were many phrases that I found myself reading again simply because they were literature at it's best. Even more interesting were the characters and the development throughout the story. Apart from perhaps Girl On The Train, the vast majority are utterly boring either weak pathetic characters or Amazon women, that have no relation to anyone that thankfully you will ever meet. Yes I can see some readers points regarding the pretty obvious twists, especially if you enjoy this section of fiction. However, did it matter, did it truly spoil the story itself. Certainly there was enough action and I can forgive that simply because the writing and the actual fact that this was so very different to the 'run of the mill' books on the market today'. As for the black and white films, wasn't this also part of the story, for sure am older than many of you as I do remember many of them and frankly like many modern films, especially this years Oscars were far more exciting and better acted.

"1079","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","A Mentally Ill Woman, Anna Fox, Witnesses Her Neighbor's Murder; Unfortunately, No One Believes Her!","J. B. Hoyos","62678426","R2XFFBB9ESDL1J","1555069833","Dr. Anna Fox, a child psychologist, lives alone in a five-story brownstone in Harlem. Suffering from agoraphobia, she is trapped inside the mansion, unable to leave. She spends most of her day playing chess, giving medical advice in a computer chat room, watching classic black-and-white films, drinking wine, taking medications, and spying on her neighbors with her Nikon D5500 camera. One evening, she witnesses the murder of one of her neighbors and calls the police. Unfortunately, no one believes her; everyone thinks she's delusional. Soon afterwards, someone begins breaking into her home at night and terrorizing her.A. J. Finn's ""The Woman in the Window"" is a tense, psychological thriller that is very disturbing. I actually lost sleep after reading this one. My heart broke for Dr. Anna Fox's plight. She is separated from her husband, Ed, and her eight-year-old daughter, Olivia. Her only associates are her physical therapist, Bina, and her psychiatrist, Dr. Julian Fielding, who keeps reminding her not to mix drugs and alcohol. However, Anna continues swallowing anti-depressants as though they are candy and guzzling bottles of wine. The combination produces hallucinations. It is not surprising that no one believes she witnessed a murder. Slowly, I began to wonder myself if she was hallucinating.I've always said that if you lose control of your life, someone else will gladly take control of it for you. However, you may not like what they do. Because of substance abuse, which has become a growing epidemic in our country, Anna loses control of her life. This also happens to Rachel Watson, an alcoholic, in ""The Girl on the Train,"" the internationally best-selling novel from Paula Hawkins. I can understand why many readers are comparing ""The Woman in the Window"" to ""The Girl on the Train.""While reading ""The Woman in the Window,"" I kept asking myself, ""Why is Anna spying on her neighbors?"" This isn't the type of behavior a professional should engage in. I could only surmise she is living her life vicariously through her neighbors. Her life has been put on hold because of the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which led to her agoraphobia. For the longest time, I kept asking myself, ""What traumatic event did Anna endure that led to the PTSD and the subsequent agoraphobia?"" What horrible incident made her seek safety and shelter in her huge, lonely brownstone? Her only contact with the outside world is through a computer chat room where she converses with strangers who suffer from a similar illness as her own.While Anna is dishing out medical advice to strangers, I kept repeating an old proverb: ""Physician, heal thyself."" Yes, I was very saddened by Anna's plot; however, at the same time, I was also very agitated, frustrated, angry, and frightened. I knew she was steadily losing control of her life and setting herself up for a very bad fall. Indeed, the fall comes when she thinks she witnesses the murder of one of the neighbors across the park. (There is a narrow strip of land with a walking path and a few benches and light posts that separate two rows of brownstones facing each other.) When the investigating detectives see the bottles of wine and pills littering her coffee table, they automatically assume she is delusional.Finn's ""The Woman in the Window"" is a superb psychological thriller. It is not a high body count slasher, it is not a shoot-'em-up crime drama, and it is not a humorous, romantic cozy. It contains a mystery that is gritty and disturbing. I'll never look at a wine bottle or a vial of pills again in the same way. I will seek solace through other means besides alcohol and drugs, prescribed or otherwise. Some readers may describe the novel's first one-hundred pages as ""slow-paced"" but I found it fascinating to learn about Anna's life as a recluse. For example, most everything she needed, such as groceries, she would have delivered to her home.Anna Fox reminded me of Sandra Bullock's character, Angela Bennett, in the popular cult film ""The Net."" Angela is a reclusive software engineer who works and lives on her home computer system and seldom ventures outside. Everything she needs and wants is on the computer's internet. Like Anna, most of Angela's friends are anonymous people she meets in a chat room. She is targeted for death when she discovers something on a floppy disc she was never meant to see. Becoming lost and consumed by the World Wide Web is a theme that has been reoccurring for several decades now. Angela set herself up for disaster by refusing to interact with flesh-and-blood people, such as her neighbors.I was surprised to learn from reading the dust jacket that ""The Woman in the Window"" has already been translated into many languages around the world and is slated to become a major motion picture. It is A. J. Finn's debut novel. I've looked at his photograph on his bio page on Amazon; he appears to be very young for someone who has worked in the publishing industry with so many best-selling authors. Now I understand the accolades from popular ones such as Stephen King, Ruth Ware, Gillian Flynn, and Louise Penny. Is Finn's novel worth the publisher's hype? I've read better novels that received less attention. Nevertheless, if readers exercise a little patience, they will enjoy some worthwhile shocks and surprises from ""The Woman in the Window.""",4

His down to earth style and relentless pursuit of what is real in health and nutrition, shared for free online, helped me lose 91 pounds in half a year.Bought the book because I wanted to know what to look out for as I age and may need to have more interaction with doctors. It did not disappoint. Coming from a background that was vegetarian as a child for several years I knew there were things about diet most doctors do not seem to know, but which without a doubt worked. Therefore I was open to considering new ideas and evidence.Very thankful for people willing to challenge the generic understandings and show in detail the research does not support many of the things we used to think were keys to health, but rather made us fatter and sicker.",5
"1089","Lessons From Lucy: The Simple Joys of an Old,…","Valuable life lessons embedded in hilarity","Grace Johnson","1501161156","R3N76WNLU53YJ8","1555070715","When you think of Dave Barry, you seldom think of the words ""self-help book,"" but that is what we have with ""Lessons From Lucy."" But it is unlike any self-help book ever written, because it is written with Barry's inimitable and incredibly funny style. The book consists primarily of seven chapters, each devoted to a Zen-like life lesson that Barry extracts from observing how his dog, Lucy, approaches life and people. These are lessons such as ""Pay attention to the people you love"" and ""Let go of anger."" As Barry notes repeatedly, these lessons are not new, but he packages them in such a humorous context that, just maybe, they will sink in deeper than when you hear them from other sources.

It would be hard for me to pick a lesson that hit home the hardest with me, but I found myself going back repeatedly to two passages I dog-eared: ""We know, when we stop to look at the big picture, that we should be happy, too: we're very fortunate people leading very good lives. But we hardly ever stop to look at the big picture. We're almost always looking at the little picture, which is a random collage of pesky chores, obligations, and annoyances."" As well as this one: ""Our existence on earth is limited; we're reminded of this every time we attend a funeral. Yet as soon as we leave the cemetery we resume pissing away our remaining hours obsessing over what are mostly minor annoyances.""

Because this is a Dave Barry book, these and other hard truths are embedded in a lot of entertaining and wacky stories that will leave the reader literally laughing out loud. My favorite of these was the chapter on letting go of anger, wherein Barry includes an absolutely hilarious transcript of his conversation with a cable service representative. There aren't many times I read something that when I remember it hours later, it's so funny I burst out laughing again just thinking about it, but Dave Barry's books--including this one--are such events.

While Lucy plays a major and crowd-pleasing role in this book, it would be a mistake to consider this a ""dog book"" or that it is intended mainly for dog lovers. It is, rather, a book about identifying the truly important priorities in life, and how to make the most of this terribly brief and precious gift of life and self-awareness we humans have been given. For this reason, I think this book would make an excellent gift for college graduates. Or anyone, actually. And while most of us have heard each of Lucy's seven lessons at various times in our lives, it is dishearteningly easy to be swept away by that ""random collage of pesky chores, obligations, and annoyances"" and forget what really matters. Living a life full of simple joys takes practice, and in that light, I was particularly delighted to see Barry's epilogue, in which he recaps the 7 lessons and grades himself on the progress he had made in carrying them out while writing this book. Barry gives himself an overall grade of a ""low B"" in this effort; I'm afraid my grade at this moment would be more like a D+. But reading this book--while giving me the biggest laughs I've had in a long time--has also inspired me to work harder on appreciating the people and good things I have in my life.",5

The substance of the book was highly informative. I come away from the book with somewhat of a step-by-step sense of how prosecutions are investigated, tried and even a bit about conviction and detention. I feel that the author was very articulate as he skillfully yet conversationally opened a window for those of us outside of law enforcement to see into what real prosecutors face, the issues they weigh and the challenges they surmount.
Prior to this, I have mostly ""known"" what can be gleaned from television shows like ""Law and Order"" or ""First 48"", which is to say this book has been a great introduction to the reality of a mostly hidden side of our civic life. I will be forever grateful for this candid account and for the appreciation it has given me for the men and women who do this work.
I listened to ""Doing Justice"" on Audible. Anybody who follows Breet Bharara's podcasts will know what a pleasant voice he has and also how well he expresses his thoughts, sometimes even quite humorously. This book is like the very best parts of one of his podcasts carefully organized for intellectual coherence, magnified and intensified by vivid examples and clear explanations.
I am struck by the deep humanity of this man, by his sense of his own limitations and the limitations of our system of justice in service of a more profound justice--also by no small measure of his hard-won wisdom and an intense pride in his profession.
In a time when the rule of law seems underappreciated, this is a much needed book.",5

Overall, it's not an easy read. But conversely it's virtually pointless to try to understand regional conflicts without a close read. Studying Directorate S will not make one an overnight expert, but it will teach one to avoid others who claim to be without years of specialized training and on-site experience. Perhaps the strongest message is that no outsider can appreciate the complexities of ancient and modern tribal, ethnic, cultural, and religious rivalries, beyond a few with high security clearances and impeccable integrity.

Coll doesn't do much undocumented editorializing, except for his contempt for how we stumbled into a war we could not win nor a peace we couldn't impose.

""No small part of N.A.T.O.'s failure to stabilize Afghanistan flowed from the disasterous decision by George W. Bush to invade Iraq in 2003. The war inflamed and mobilized deeper resistance to American counterterrorism policy and warfare in the Muslim world."" (pg 664)

This because it is easy to read, by good compact chapters, and among what we read in all of these chapters, probably we all have discovered, or will discover, existence of yet another lie which not before knew about.To me, one of points I noticed, was the measure of the Thyroid, which I will ask for getting measured, for bout me and I by my wife, by over next blood measures.Until recently, the doctors especially told us not to have the max cholesterol number higher than 200 in max, and during 9 years, I called it nonce.

That is, being told so, even though by the year 2008, in an article about rapport results, in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Associations), it finally had been stated that there is nothing bad in taking nuts or seeds (of course not too much).Again, there are many helpful information throughout this book.",5

This effort by a Harvard professor will be enjoyed by those readers interested in the development of the modern age in the West, especially in terms of the arts, literature, history, politics, and economics. Once read, this book will send many readers off to bookstores to order other more in-depth biographies on many of the fascinating individual figures that appear here due to their membership in The Club.

Professor Damrosch has done a great service in reintroducing some of the greats of any age to today's population. And, for laying out again some of the best quotes ever written or uttered.

Well kids, it’s finally happened. After a decade of wanting Alec and Magnus in the spotlight, our prayers have FINALLY BEEN ANSWERED. Malec has been my OTP from the moment I read City of Bones a decade ago (sorry Jace and Clary, I love you but…) and now they’re FINALLY getting their moment. This was the first LGBTQ+ relationship I ever read about as a teen and I can’t tell you how amazing it was to see it highlighted so spectacularly in this novel.

I’m not gonna lie, it took me a hot minute to get into this book. It was SUPER weird to shift my mindset back in the shadowhunter timeline to the middle of The Mortal Instruments. Both Magnus and Alec were so unsure and hesitant with each other and it was just so odd! I’m so used to the current Malec being confident and strong in their relationship. I mean, they have two kids and just got married for god sakes. For the first several chapters, I had to remind myself of the events in City of Glass and remember they had literally JUST gotten together when this took place.

HOWEVER. Once it gets going it was was easy to work out the kinks and get into the story. It was kind of like reading a little treasure hunt, picking out the things or people that eventually play a bigger part in this universe down the road. I absolutely LOVED all of the cameos and I think Raphael was my favorite. He is literally me at any and all social gatherings. Seriously, that boy is a #MOOD. And we get to see how Aline and Helen meet!!! Aline became one of my favorite lady shadowhunters during Queen of Air and Darkness and it was great seeing their relationship up close and personal.

And Malec guys. Oh my god. MALEC. I can’t tell you how completely and utterly delightful it was to read about them. Soooooooooo many adorable moments.

The arcs their characters AND relationship go through is awesome and I loved watching the transformation as they learned to trust one another. It’s also really interesting because this book adds a layer of complexity to their relationship that wasn’t there in the last three books of The Mortal Instruments. It all happened so quick during those novels and as devastated as I was over their break up in City of Lost Souls, they had only been dating a few months. It didn’t seem like THAT big a deal in the grand scheme of things. But after reading this, it’s obvious that they were a lot closer and more in love than I realized. Alec seemed so confident and sure of their relationship by the end of this book that it’s difficult to match it with who he becomes later on. I’m super curious to see how the next two books play out in this series.

<U+21AC> FINAL WORD

This book is FREAKING ADORABLE AND YOU’LL LOVE IT!! Malec is the best and I didn’t think it was possible to love them any more, but HERE WE ARE. WOW.",4

As a voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction crime novels, I was really looking forward to it.  All of the sterling reviews and ""NY Times Bestseller"" designation suggested that it would be gripping.  NOT!  In effect, the book essentially describes the many rapes and murders committed by an anonymous psychopath, bouncing back and forth between and among many venues and many time periods.  For reasons that escape me, the authors who assembled the researcher's notes and manuscripts never provide a sufficient context for their work.  Unless the reader already knows the entire backstory, the book can be confusing and, frankly, boring.  Unless one enjoys reading account after account how the culprit entered homes and committed atrocities, the narrative sometimes feels like you're reliving Groundhog Day.  Personal insights by the pursuer are occasionally insightful, and the methodology of criminal pursuit (as it has evolved with technology), might make the book an interesting work for criminal justice classes on the history of criminology.

I love Fleetwood Mac. A lot! A story of rock and roll in the 1970s full of larger than life characters and their drama. Yes, please! Sign me up! I was initially disappointed in the interview format of the book. It was hard for me to get into. Without a typical descriptive narrative, I had a hard time picturing the characters and their world. But the story had me hooked, so I kept reading. And I’m so glad I did. By the time I was about a third of the way through the book, I was enjoying the oral interview format of the book. It was playing out in my mind like an episode of VH1’s “Behind the Music”. Since individuals experience the same events differently, and memory can be a tricksy beast, I really enjoyed the differences in the band members’ recollections and how perception and misunderstandings shaped the band members’ relationships with each other. And then that subtle little twist at the end had me close to tears. DAISY JONES AND THE SIX is a story about music, love and friendship and the pressures and joys that come with them. But more than that it’s a story about the choices we make, the things we do and don’t do, the things we say and don’t say and how the intersection of those words and actions shapes not only our lives, but the lives of the people we love. And wouldn’t it be amazing if someone could record “Aurora”. I would love to listen to that. DAISY JONES AND THE SIX is a 4.5 out of 5 <U+0001F31F> for me. I can’t wait to see what Taylor comes up with next. <U+0001F60A><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F4DA>",4

If you don't think government officials in America can be evil and corrupt, you are living in a fantasy land.Look to France, Venezuela, the U.K., all around the world. Look at what socialist policies, promoted as ""social justice"" and ""progressivism"" have done to destroy the middle class and pool the wealth of the world for the evil elites. The main stream media simply will not tell you about the massive protests and revolutions going on in countries that have taken away the rights of the people and imposed so many taxes that people have difficulty buying food and just surviving. That's because the main stream media has been bought and paid for by the very same evil elites who want you fooled and docile. That is why we need heroes like the anonymous authors of this book to shine light in the darkness. And that is why you need to wake up to reality.Don't let them steal your children's future. Don't let them make slaves of us. Wake up, see the truth, and join the fight to take America back.

For having fallen suddenly from grace, those in the Confederacy share a certain perspective. Knowing beauty, influence, fame, and privilege to be borrowed rather than bestowed, they are not easily impressed. They are not quick to envy or take offense. They certainly do not scour the papers in search of their own names. They remain committed to living among their peers, but they greet adulation with caution, ambition with sympathy, and condescension with an inward smile.""",5

Quinn has written a war story, a love story, and a mystery all in one.  Ian and Tony are hunting the Huntress- a down right evil German woman who killed children and shot a man in cold blood as WWII was ending.  Jordan has a new stepmother but there's something very wrong with Annaliese.  Seriously.  Nina- Nina is one of the best characters I've read in a long time.  She's a rip roaring Soviet pilot who is out for the Huntress- and she's married to Ian, who rescued her from her sickbed in Poland.  How these come together makes for a fascinating story. Well plotted with characters you can feel, this is so worth your time.  My only quibble- and I must point this out because whoever edited this otherwise perfect book should have caught it- is that Jordan is served a slice of German chocolate cake at her father's funeral in 1950.  That cake was invented by a Texas woman in 1957.  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.  I'm recommending this one!",5

Williams","0062678426","R31PCXB11N0D3M","1555089271","The biggest disappointment for me in this psychological thriller was the unconvincing portrayal of the heroine, Dr. Anna Fox. The author is a male, but he chooses to tells this story through his main character who is a woman. Only thing is, nothing about her portrayal as a female is at all female to me. Nothing rings true, not even a little bit. Nothing maternal,where maternal is called for, nothing sexy about her in any detail of the plot where such would be expected, nothing soft, simply bogus. Even her appearance is somehow out of sync with what we know. She is 30-something, but in every description I’m seeing a septuagenarian, or older. Very weird choices have been made by the author . Also, his overdosing us with her alcohol and drug habit is cloying. Enough already! I get it; she uses substance to get through having been traumatized by events, but at the rate we witness her imbibing and drugging, she would not even be able to notice anything from her windows, were she even able to remain conscious enough to see out of them, and yet, the author asks us to suspend our logic as he wants us to believe him as much as she wants to convince the police that she saw what she saw. All too tedious and really got hideously in the way of what could have been a pretty good read. I just did not like this book. No literary merit here that I could find. This plot is pretty conventional, so at the end of the day, to be outstanding, an author would have to really work on character development and details presented in a fresh and lyrical way,",5

"1422","K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches","Excellent book on pitching","LSmith","0385541015","R1CQ1LLF29KX7T","1555155502","In order to be a successful pitcher in Major League Baseball, it is highly recommended that a pitcher has more than one type of pitch he uses to consistently get batters out. Through the history of the game, ten pitches have been used most frequently and a discussion on each one of them is the basis of this excellent book by Tyler Kepner.

Pitches that are popular in today’s game, such as the fastball, cutter and slider, as well as pitches that are now phased out or given a new name, such as a screwball or splitter, are all discussed. Everything about a particular pitch is discussed. Kepner’s thorough research is on display each time he writes about pitchers in the early history of the game who threw the pitch being discussed without it being called the current name. Interviews with pitchers who threw the pitch with much success, such as Sandy Koufax and Bert Blyleven on the curveball chapter, add valuable insight into the specific pitch as well.

However, what really made this book a joy to read was the smooth and easy flow this book takes. The writing is outstanding in that it keeps that balance that a non-fan who wants to learn about pitching can do so without feeling overwhelmed, yet it is technical enough so that hard-core fans are not bored or disappointed because it is too simple for their tastes. Humor is spread throughout the book, both from pitchers being interviewed and the author himself. The information is also thorough since pitches that are no longer used or legal (such as the spitball), there isn’t an era, pitch or pitcher that isn’t covered.

No matter what level of fan a reader is or what is his or her favorite era of the game, this book is one that should be added to the collection of baseball books. If pitching is supposedly 90% of the game, then every baseball fan needs to read this to be informed of that 90%.

I wish to thank Doubleday Books for providing a copy of the book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",5

Jack Torrance has had a long history of drinking and rage issues that have threatened to tear his family apart and have recently lost him a prestigious teaching position. Taking the job as the winter care-taker of the closed for the season Overlook Hotel seems like the perfect way to re-bond with his family and to write his novel. But the hotel has other plans. Plans that send Jack spiraling doward deeper and deeper into insanity.In a previous review, I mentioned that Salem's Lot is my favorite King novel. I continue to stand by that statement even as I say that The Shining is one of his better written novels. The depth of the story and richness of his description in this novel are at the top of his game.Truly a great novel that I highly recommend.",5

Harriet bakes gingerbread that tastes ""like eating revenge."" They have dolls that are sentient.Harriet says she is originally from Druhustrana, a non-existent country. Perdita desperately wants to reunite her mother with her Druhastranian friend, Gretel Kercheval. The Lee family gingerbread recipe was stolen from the Kercheval family.In an effort to understand her heritage, Perdita tries making the recipe, but adds ingredients andwinds up in a coma. Harriet knows she finally owes her daughter the long-avoided truth about her origins.Oyeyemi takes the familiar children's tale and twists it into something completely different. I may be in the minority on this one, but I was just lost most of the time, without the benefits of a bread-crumb trail.

I have always thought I had an underappreciated face.” When I first started reading Defy Me and realized Kenji was one of the narrators, I was so excited!

I have a rollercoaster relationship with this series. I didn’t like Shatter Me with Juliette’s overbearing whining. I sort of liked Unravel Me and then Ignite Me hooked me in. But after, Restore Me felt a lot like trying to resurrect a story that should have been complete with the trilogy...up until the end of the book, and my interested was again peaked.

This brings us to Defy Me. When I first started reading the book, it started with Kenji’s POV and I thought, I. AM. IN! And he did stay true to being the best voice in this book. But soon things went downhill. I could do without all the torture; it gets heavy handed. The sadistic torture goes on and on, almost as filler to an unnecessary degree. The book takes some weird turns that don’t always make sense and can be frustrating. I am left wondering how the next book will be. I will undoubtedly read it if there is a shred of hope Kenji’s point of view is in it.",4

I've been through it myself, and this captured not just the crushing sorrow of it all, but also the black humor that can run through your head. Far better than just about anything you'll ever get in literary fiction.Unlike literary writers, King doesn't use the crutch of vagueness and leaving things unsaid to express sadness. He comes out and writes about it explicitly, and the result is...fantastic.""Sometimes dead is better"" is the theme of the book. However, it doesn't just show us the fact that death is important and necessary to make way for new life, it makes us FEEL it.I think this is one of King's less popular works, at least based on the number of reviews, because Louis Creed, the main character, is relatively plain for the first two-thirds of the book.

In The Shining, Stephen King shows more than just his ability to make you sleep with your lights on.  I am the first to admit that The Shining is by far one of the scariest novels I have ever read, but what adds to its greatness is ability to operate on many levels. The novel leaves the reader completely satisfied with a good scare and a pertinent story.  The novel focuses on the Torrance family.  Jack, the father, is writer with a temper who recently lost his job.  Jack has been sober for almost a year and he is offered a job to take care of a hotel in Colorado in its off season.  The family, along with his wife Wendy and their son Danny who has a very special gift, look at the job as an opportunity to regroup and get Jack writing going.  Danny has a gift that allows him to see things that are going to happen in the future and sense things that most people can't.  His gift gets a name eventually and is called the shining.  The novel is structured in a five-act play type of format and the action never ceases with every turn of the page.  In contrast to the film, which is successful in its own right, the novel doesn't focus on Jack (played by Jack Nicholson in the film) as the antagonist, but rather the conflict comes with the hotel versus the entire Torrance family. In order for the family to move on they must face the horrible things in their past.  The hotel as they find out has a past and the family experiences unimaginable terror as they are stranded in the hotel during the harsh Colorado winter.  Jack develops a fascination with the hotel and becomes more and more interested in history darker history.  The Hotel uses Jack as instrument to get to Danny.  The only thing they can't help the Torrance family is binding to together and facing the Hotel's past as well as their own.  The setting, as usual, shows King's mastery at picking places that we all might have had a fear of from time to time.  On another level the choice of the hotel is perfect in trying to represent a place that could have an amazing past.  Any number of things could happen in a hotel because of different kinds of people that could have inhabited its rooms. King also establish rich characters and as Jack Torrance gets to his brink you fear and feel sympathy for him at the same time.  Stephen King has not only mastered his craft in fear but he takes this novel a step further by having a family face their own past.  Everyone has something that haunts them in their past and the only way to find out if the Torrance family is successful conquering theirs is to face your own fears and read this book.",5

A recovering alcoholic, Jack's teaching career was shot after he attacked a student who had vandelled his car. His marriage is strained to the limits, having injured his son, Danny, when on a drinking binge. Jack has been to rock bottom and is trying to claw his way back. The job at the Overlook seems to be just what Jack needs.The Overlook is a majestic hotel, nestled deep in the Rockies. Closed for the winter, the hotel requires an off-season caretaker. Jack's old drinking buddy happened to have a seat on the board and pulled some strings to get him the position. For Jack, this job would be ideal. An opportunity to stay dry, to work on his unfinished play, and to try to mend his broken family.But Jack's son has a gift and the hotel has a dark past and a life of its own.Of the bajillion and one Stephen King novels in the world, this is likely the best. King is best when he is writing about his fears, and the pages of this book are ripe with them. Many of Kings later works seem strained... but this particular work is so raw and truthful. In the best tradition of American horror - a tradition King had a large hand in creating - the book takes a typical family and then throws them hip deep into the supernatural. The fear of the ghosts and creeps in this book are made all the more frightning as they're co-mingled with fears such as providing for the family, the fear of hurting a loved one, the fear of losing one's grip on reality.And then there's the hotel.Ranking with Jackson's Hill House or Matheson's Belasco House, the Overlook Hotel is one of the best realizations of the haunted house in American literature.There have been two attempts to adapt the book to film. The first being Kubric's much ballyhoo'd adaptation, which I frankly didn't like much. The second being a made-for-tv adaptation, which came closer to the spirit of the book -if you'll pardon the pun- but still wasn't quite right. Do yourself a favour and give both films a miss and curl up in front of the fire with a nice cup of cocoa and a copy of The Shining.Tragic gives this book 10 out of 10 bottles of redrum.",5

The Overlook Hotel, a posh mountain resort in the Colorado Rockies, is no exception.  Built in the early 1900's, the Overlook's history is long and colorful.  A child dies of asphyxiation on the playground, a spurned lover leaps from a third floor window, a rich old woman commits suicide in a second floor bathtub, three men are slain in a gangland murder in the presidential suite.  Is it bad luck, or is there some deeper meaning to the Overlook's tragic past?Dick Halloran, the hotel's head chef, knows a little of the Overlook's history.  Dick has what some people would call a ""psychic twinkle"", but what he himself calls ""the shining.""  Whatever you want to call it, what Dick has is the ability to see things that others do not.  Sometimes he can see what people are thinking.  Sometimes he can catch glimpses of the future, or the past.  For people like Dick Halloran, the Overlook Hotel seems to come alive.  The mask slips aside slightly, allowing a glimpse of the true face beneath, and the true face of the Overlook is not pleasant at all.Enter Jack Torrance.  Jack was once a young up-and-comer in the literary field.  With several published stories, a post at a prestigious New England prep school, a beautiful wife, and a young son, his destiny seemed sure.  But Jack has a couple of problems: alcoholism and rage.  The two problems combined have proven too much for Jack, costing him his job, not to mention the prospect of finding another one, and nearly costing him his family.  Luckily, Jack has friends in high places.  Al Shockley, who happens to own a controlling interest in the Overlook Hotel, sets Jack up to be the hotel's caretaker during the winter months when the Overlook is closed.  It is the perfect opportunity for Jack, Wendy, and Danny.  A positive mark on Jack's resume, and plenty of solitude for him to finish the play he has been writing.  A cooling-off period if you will.There is just one small problem.  Jack's son, five-year-old Danny, has what Dick Halloran has: the shining.  And when Dick meets the family, he is amazed to find that Danny shines stronger than anyone he has ever met.  Dick tries to warn Danny about the Overlook, but the boy is only five after all.The first couple of months at the Overlook are among the happiest that Jack, Wendy, and Danny have shared as a family, but the longer Danny, with his unusually powerful senses, spends in the hotel, the livelier the hotel becomes.  Danny is the winding key that starts the Overlook Hotel in motion.  Danny with his powerful shine.  The Overlook wants Danny so that it can run forever and ever, but to get Danny, it must first get Jack.  Poor Jack, who is already half-mad, is the perfect tool for the hotel to get what it wants.  And Jack is a willing tool.  The Overlook represents his last, best hope for getting the train-wreck of his life back on the rails.  It is a conundrum that can never be solved.  Jack must save the hotel to save his family, but the Overlook Hotel has plans of its own.Jack Torrance's slow decline into madness is as heartbreaking as it is inevitable.  Even after reading The Shining half a dozen times or so, I still find myself cheering for Jack, urging him to straighten up, to get away from the Overlook before it destroys him, always to no avail.  I can think of no other author that invokes such a strong commitment from his readers, for his characters.  Stephen King's ability to make the reader care about his characters has always been his strong point, and I can think of no other audiobook where he did it as well as he did with Jack Torrance in The Shining.Campbell Scott is kind of a no-frills audiobook narrator.  He does little to differentiate between the voices of the characters, but somehow that's okay.  Maybe I'm more lenient because The Shining is just such a great story.  I had no trouble finishing this audiobook as I do with some of the more boring narrators.The Shining is for all of us who have suffered addictions or other personal demons, and tried to overcome them.  King's own personal experience is evident throughout the audiobook.",5

Roy Watson","198211598X","R3M29PYZ3NNNEK","1555177759","The Shining is King at his best - striving for (and achieving) quality rather than length.  The story is taut, well-written, relentlessly building toward a terrifying climax.If your only acquaintance with The Shining is  from the movie by Stanley Kubrick, starring Jack Nicholson, you've missed  out on something.  Nicholson's performance, while memorable (who could ever  forget, ""Here's Johnny!""), changed the whole story, and not for  the better.  Nicholson's crazed, wild-eyed looks let you know within five  minutes of the opening credits that the main character, Jack Torrance, is  dangerously close to a major breakdown.  The rest of the movie is  anticlimactic.In the book, however, Jack Torrance starts out as a much  different character.  He's an author, a  former heavy drinker who broke his  son's arm once in a fit of rage, got himself fired from a teaching position  by attacking a student, and has barely held his marriage and life together.  But...he _has_ stopped drinking, he's mended his marriage, he's managing  the anger, and he's taken a menial job (tending the Overlook Hotel) to  support his family.  And, because not enough time has passed to restore his  good name yet, he's doing it all while enduring distrust from those around  him, as well as occasional humiliating charity.The caretaker job does  have it's advantages though; long months of complete solitude in which he  can step back from all the problems he's had, and can take the time to  finish making things right with his family.  Not to mention that it's a  perfect place for him to finish his latest book, a story he can already see  is very good - good enough to be proud of, and good enough to put some real  momentum back in his career.In other words...Jack is back, or at least  well on his way; and even his first steps in getting it together show a lot  of promise of things to come.  Unfortunately, the Overlook, and its ghastly  inhabitants, have other plans for him, his wife, and especially his son  Danny, a five-year old psychic prodigy.  The story that ensues is more  subtle - and tragic - than anything Kubrick and Nicholson dreamed of.",4

Yes, the writing was elegant and layered, but, if I had wanted to read a novel truly written in the Russian style, I probably would have chosen Tolstoy.  I recognize that the writing was quite stylized, but it was also labored and slow, so slow that my sister, who read it at the same time, commented that the two weeks it took us to read it was the longest seven years of her life.  In the end, it seemed to me that the author was simply showing off his ability to write in the Russian manner, a tour de force but not a book that I would recommend to others.",3

War has a way of sanding down your virtue.

I reenact my own Cinderella routine sans the discarded pump. If Cinderella had paid what I did for these shoes, she’d have made sure she left the ball with both, too.

If I’m going to have regrets in this life, I’d rather them be for the chances I took and not the opportunities I let slip away.

The line between villain and hero is whisper thin, and, very frequently, a matter of perspective. Gray, Miss Perez. We operate in the gray.

My Review:

I was completely sucked into Ms. Cleeton’s well-crafted and deftly written cloak and dagger vortex as I zigzagged the globe while she brilliantly unfolded her impressive tale of Beatriz Perez, Cuban femme fatale. Her captivating storylines sparkled with intrigue, betrayals, passion, family drama, an epic love, patriotism, scandal, and tropical heat. The engaging plot was quickly paced and highly eventful while blending fact and fiction with stunning agility in an informative yet entertaining and evocative manner.

Ms. Cleeton’s writing activated a long forgotten grade school memory flash of participating in those ridiculous duck and cover drills and being reprimanded for giggling while sitting under my desk. And I am proud to exclaim that I finally, yes finally, have a grasp on the atrocity of the Bay of Pigs and the disgraceful betrayals of the US government that caused such butchery, which is nothing new and probably even worse now, yet still, so disheartening. The 60s really were a mess!",5

"1733","Free to Focus: A Total Productivity System to Achieve More by Doing Less","The simplest route to more time with who and what we love!","James F Reid","0801075262","R5MJXSZK5HKA7","1555233608","Before I was exposed to Free to Focus, I was a hot mess. My family and I just moved to a new city and state, I had just started a new business, and the tasks on my to-do list were reaching the 20s and 30s almost every day. To say I was overwhelmed, overworked, and frustrated on a daily basis is an understatement. I had reached the place I said I’d never go again: burnout. I felt like crap physically, mentally, and emotionally.

All I wanted was to spend more quality time with my family, while building a successful business. And, yes, I wanted to feel great, too. It all seemed like a pipe dream...that it would take some kind of miracle to change my situation (like winning the lottery...LOL).

Time was against me - I never seemed to have enough of it. I felt like I was on my own island...no help in my business (it was just me), meanwhile, I had four other people staring me in my eyes every day, counting on me to be a husband, father, and person who put food on the table.

I was scared to death. Every day, MULTIPLE times a day, I would ask myself, “How am I going to pull this off?” “I’m destined to screw this up if I keep going like this.” I knew deep down inside I had no control of my life and schedule...everything and everyone around me controlled it.

Until one day, I had reached my breaking point. I had THREE major things I had to get done. But I remember sitting at my desk at 5PM and NONE (yes, NONE) of those three things were done. The sad reality is I needed those three tasks done to be able to collect a check and cover business and personal bills in two weeks.

What the heck just happened? I started my workday at 8AM. What did I do for 9 hours? I’ll tell you what I did. Answered texts. Responded to emails. Picked up the phone when anyone would call. Stopped and did laundry (ugh!). I could keep going, but, bottom line, I was doing everything BUT what I needed to do.

Something needed to change, AND FAST. Too much was at stake - my business, my marriage, my LIVELIHOOD.

A few days after my breakdown, I was scrolling through Facebook and noticed a post about Michael Hyatt’s “Free to Focus” productivity system. At first, I snickered because I was like, “I need productivity surgery, not a new system.” I was that cynical. But, then I remembered taking Michael’s Best Year Ever course - and how he had a way of making the goal-setting process simple for me. And how after applying those principles, I had one of the most successful years of my life.

So, naturally, I wondered if Free to Focus could do the same thing. I said, what the heck. I have nothing to lose. Buy Free to Focus, go all in and see if this works just as well as Best Year Ever. I was beyond desperate. NOTHING was working for me.
My plan was to do what I do with most books - read the whole thing, then go back through and implement things I liked.

Well, one chapter into Free to Focus I realized my plan wasn’t going to work. This book is written in a way that each chapter builds off one another. The thing Michael Hyatt does masterfully in this book is that he breaks you in with baby steps, many of which have to do with your mindset towards productivity and success. That’s why I continue to consume, read, and apply Hyatt’s works...he knows his audience and how to get us results.

He knows we’re busy, overwhelmed, and desperately need help. So, the way he breaks things down and then gives us bite-sized chunks of how to apply them speaks directly to us and prevents the overwhelm. The best part about this book and system - you can implement at your own pace. That’s what carried me to the finish line...I realized I MUST apply these strategies and use the resources if I wanted to see change in my life and business, and the fact that Michael empowered me to do it at my own pace was exactly what I needed in this season of my life. I already had too much on my plate (and the thought of change sucks!).

Fast forward three months after applying every resource found in Free to Focus. I found myself less-rushed throughout the day. I actually felt proud of myself that I had control of my own calendar. I’ll be honest, it was tough saying “no” to a lot of things in order to truly apply the Free to Focus resources, but the short-term pain has led to my long-term gain - in EVERY area of my life. I’m sleeping better...I’m more focused during my workday...I’m less irritable (because, again, I feel as though I have more control of my calendar AND emotions), the quality of my work has gone through the roof, AND (and this is my BIGGEST “and”) my time with my family is now QUALITY time. Although I still have bad days, they’re less frequent - I’m more intentional and present during my time with my family, and not thinking about work and other things that would pull my attention away from them. As a result, my marriage has deepened and my relationship with my kids has seen a significant uptick. I’m also now able to coach my kids' sports teams, and volunteer in the community when I want.

Little did I know that a “productivity” book would transform my life and the way I do business. The biggest shift that happened to me after applying Free to Focus in my life was this - I realized I COULD have success WHILE being the person I wanted to be...the person I MUST be for my family and clients - the people counting on me. Bottom line, if you’re reading this and sound like me, my encouragement to you is this: just open this book with an open mind and commitment to at least try out its tools. If you do, your life and business will change. The simplicity and practicality of this book was a breath of fresh air. And, BTW, everyone that I’ve shared these strategies with has seen results...some as quickly as 24 hours.

If you’re ready to get out of the rat race and ditch overwhelm and distraction for good, then read the book, do EVERYTHING Michael encourages you to do, and then sit back and watch the results. It’s amazing what happens!",5

They were quite a chore to read, and I understand they help set up the final trilogy, but I almost did not make it though those books. They really should have been one book.

Then came book 7, which setup the new trilogy and finally brought in the Aliens. It was a good book, but looking back its main role was to setup book 8. Book 8 is amazing! It may be the best book in the series. Why is it the best book, because all sort of crazy Alien stuff is finally happening. I am honestly only half way through the book, but it brings back everything you loved about book 1, with most of your favorite characters playing major parts.

Highly recommend this book. My only suggestion is I wish there was a character list at the start of the book so I could be reminded of who everyone is and what book they came from.",5

This book got me to go deeper. Free to focus was easy to understand but went one step further than other books, since it comes with links to resources-exercises you do after each section that have you apply what you’re learning to your own life.

I think this is what sets this book apart. It’s easy to read about cutting things from your list, it’s another to actually list out your tasks and do it. I also learned about things I thought I knew how to do, like delegation ... now I realize that I don’t do this as effectively or as intentionally as I could.

This book also acknowledges the importance of self-care in recharging so there's energy for productivity. Rather than the more, more, more burnout philosophy of other productivity systems.

"1875","Daisy Jones & The Six: A Novel","UNFORGETTABLE!!","Ellen","1524798622","R6EODA02ZB22I","1555246925","""The truth often lies, unclaimed, in the middle.""I WILL NEVER GET OVER THIS BOOK!!! All the stars to Taylor Jenkins Reid! Everything about this book was a pure delight. I absolutely loved the format! The book is told as a series of interviews with Daisy Jones, a singer and songwriter, as well as with the members of The Six, a seventies rock band. Also included are interviews with their closed friends, managers, wives, journalists and significant others. I was riveted!Daisy was a lost soul when she met up with the members of The Six but yet she was always a brilliant songwriter and singer in her own right. There is a huge clash of egos when she is asked to join the band and this inside look at this fictional band is how I always imagined real-life bands behaving. Daisy is both strong and fragile, and brilliant but terribly insecure.""I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else’s muse. I am not a muse. I am the somebody. End of ... story.""I was transported back to my teen years listening to seventies rock & roll while reading this book. The story evoked feelings of longing, loss and the rush of hearing a really great song for the first time. The book focuses on the meteoric rise of The Six and what it took in the seventies to make it big. The importance of magazines like 'Rolling Stone' and radio airplay seems irrelevant now but that is what made rock musicians superstars years ago. And the non-stop partying is not shied away from here. It's a wonder anyone ever made it out alive.“I can’t think of any two things that make you quite as self-absorbed as addiction and heartbreak. I had a selfish heart. I didn’t care about anyone or anything but my own pain. My own need. My own aching. I’d have made anyone hurt if it could have taken some of mine away. It’s just how sick I was.”I also was enthralled by the book's three very strong female protagonists. Daisy, Karen and Camila each had their own way of coping with fame, addiction, love and heartbreak. They all felt VERY real to me and I felt like I was reading a non-fiction biography of a favorite rock band. But the main focus of the book was the relationship between Daisy and Billy, the lead singer and songwriter for of The Six. Their chemistry was volatile and they both brought out the best and the worst in each other. Yet the music they made together was pure magic.""You know how sometimes people will describe other people and say they make you feel like you’re the only one in the room? Billy and Daisy could both do that. But they somehow did it with each other. They each seemed like they thought the other one was the only person in the room. Like we were watching two people who didn’t realize thousands of people were watching them.""This book is creative, surprising, heartbreaking and uplifting. I can't recommend it highly enough! Of course there was a stunning twist that I never saw coming. I still have a book hangover a week after finishing and I can't stop thinking and Daisy, Bill and The Six. This is also the rare book that I have read and also plan to listen to on audio. Don't miss this book! 5+++++ stars.“Oh, honey, I can wait/To call that home/I can wait for the blooms and the honeycomb.”",5

They savor the terse and virile writers like Conrad and James Dickey, even Louis L’Amour, and they share Hemingway’s ardor for fishing. One summer break, they decide to rough it in the Northern Canadian wilderness and take a month-long river canoe trip. They are experienced in all things wilderness, and are well-prepped for the journey (except for not taking a sat phone for safety—the only incredulous decision-making in the novel). Off they go for the outdoor expedition of their lives!Jack has a past of great loss that he still hasn’t resolved, possesses a bit of a glass half empty philosophy, and is quick and instinctive in judgment. Wynn is more studied and spiritual, more glass half full in his outlook. They complement each other, and take pride in their acumen with all things river, canoe, and wilderness. Heller, who is also a Dartmouth grad and has kayaked all over the world, must have a trace of Jack and Wynn within him. And, like his previous novel, THE PAINTER, he seamlessly intersects nature and art, so that the landscape, in his frequently anthropomorphic, metaphorical descriptions, is a character in itself.“The implacability and violence of nature always awed him. That it could be entirely heedless and yet so beautiful…But also its intricate intelligence. Its balancings. Its quiet compensations. It was like some unnamed justice permeated everything.”The story kicks off quickly and the challenges they face will test their better angels vs. their demons. Nature and man commingle and combust in equal measure, and the pages turn heatedly as you journey to the end of the river with the two young men. Is this river trip truly heaven on earth, or will it be a hellish grave? The twists, turns, perils, and eternal poetry of the wilderness are reflected in Heller’s prose. I was breathless when I came to the end.",5

Teenagers Sasha, Julian, David, and Allie find a gun buried in the ground. Nothing good can come of that. When another teenager is shot dead playing Russian roulette, guilt changes all their lives forever.

The author’s writing quality is spot-on as usual. However, the first half of the book is set twenty years before the present and reads like a young adult book. Sasha is an unrepentant Mean Girl—only her needs matter. Julian is in love with Sasha mostly from afar thanks to his “hobby” of peeping into windows. Allie is a conflicted chubby good girl broken by her sister’s recent death and mother’s emotional breakdown. David is being forced to be a star tennis player by his father regardless of his own desires. All are teenage stereotypes with little else distinguishing them.

I forced myself to read the first half in the hopes of a great twisty conclusion. I was disappointed unfortunately. The denouement’s big surprise is completely unbelievable. In my opinion, Someone Knows was a failure from start to finish. Please read any other book by this author rather than this one. You will be glad you did. I’m giving this mess 2 stars because the writing, grammar and spelling are first rate. But the plot...the plot.

He can really tell a story, flesh it out and pace it very well. He's also great at creating a believable, ordinary setting and then infusing the supernatural in a fairly believable way.

It's most effective when describing his cat. I would say the highlight was the old man Jud's tale of Timmy Baterman; that was truly effective and eerie. By the final climax, it's predictable and off-and-on effective. He's most effective when he's using small details to set an ominous tone. The climax is over the top; it might have been more effective if the son had just been an eerie zombie and not a murderous one. Like others said, it almost becomes a ""Chucky bloodbath"".His use of pop culture references is effective, if over used. He's used that device before and generally it somehow grounds the atmosphere of supernatural into an everyday setting which is what King excels at. Also, he refers to death as ""Oz, the Great and Terrible"", based on a child's view of Death as a force. It's overused, but very effective; it fits in with his meditation on death as an ever-present unavoidable danger that we all fight but ultimately surrender to. This is a tale of not accepting death; someone said he could've put more profound thoughts into this but I think he does a pretty good job for a popular novel. I don't expect serious existentiality in a horror tale; he makes his points in a believable way through the eyes of his characters. One of his strong points is in illustrating a character's inner thoughts to really show the true horror. He's much better at this than a typical bloodbath ending.Speaking of characters, his two most effective are Jud the old man (even if it seems cliche of Wise Country Old Timer, it works) and the undead cat. They set the tone of dread and demonstrate compelling force that lurks in the Indian burial ground. I also liked his invocation of the classic monster, the Wendigo, even if its purpose was a little vague. He could've elaborated more on why it was there. There are some vague allusions to cannibalism that don't quite fit, even though he talks about cannibalizing one's grief and sanity. I guess it works but...Like others, I thought the scene of the funeral fight was over the top and unnecesary and lent an unintended slapstick to an otherwise serious story in which death was an everpresent malevolent force.King and some of his readers have said this was his scariest book; i haven't read much King so I can't say, but The Stand was much better at creating a very creepy tone of dread. Also, apparently he did this fairly early in his career-he shelved it for a long while- so it does showcase his talent pretty well. His pacing is impeccable and his skills for creating tension are tight. The grave digging and night scenes are pretty brilliant, as his wife and Jud's futile efforts to stop a morbid escapade.I also enjoyed the historical devices of Jud's tales of setting the history of the burial ground; it's such a cliche to say ""Indian burial ground' in horror. So it helps to create a believable back story there. He actually gets away with using a well-worn device.Overall, it has very strong points and a somewhat predictable and disappointing end. As I said before, I would've preferred less of a blood bath and more of an eerie zombie ending. His creation of eerie zombies (as opposed to the brain-eating, Night of the LIving Dead kind) was very effective and chilling. It felt much more real than the movie stereotype.",4

Written by identical twin sisters (who offer frequent pop culture references, real-talk asides, and emphatically describe things to a reader, as if highlighting concepts with wiggly jazz hands), they define burnout as a mix of prolonged emotional labor, caregiver fatigue, and feeling as though your efforts are not noticed or rewarded. They advise their readers to confront and respond to stressors in a full circle, complete-the-process sorta way, finding what works for you and self-care that works, addressing debilitating self-talk, charting the plus and minuses of a decision that needs to be made, being comfortable with who you are and how you look, shrugging off expectation and nearly unreal societal standards, and seeking & maintaining meaningful connections with others - all with a heavy hand in narrative therapy tactics.",5

"1978","Top 10 Games You Can Play In Your Head, By Yourself: Second Edition","Please give this book a chance and have an open mind - it's amazing!!!","Andrew","998379417","R2C1XXJDSVHZKA","1555254811","Little premise: I love Sherlock Holmes and the Mind Palace technique, and the way it's portrayed in various media. I've made my Mind Palace into an extended Sanctuary similar to the beginning of this book, so it was easier for me to jump into the stories. For the uninitiated, a mind palace is basically a mental building or set of rooms and places where you can mentally walk through them, and place objects or memory triggers in order to remember information. I've been using this technique for everything from studying to learning new skills to memorizing grocery lists and names of people I meet.From the first exercise alone, I was able to clearly envision the game and play against myself easily, and no joke: it's legit fun. Being able to play these kinds of games, once I have the rules and structures down, is really really fun, and I really enjoyed it all the way to the end of the book. Having the rules in place gave me clear direction about where to go, and then it sets me loose to create all sorts of fun.I've got a few original characters that I've slotted into the protagonist or antagonist positions in the games, and I've made it so that my personal self was more of the game master than anything else, moving around characters like chess pieces and watching some fun interactions play out. It's literally inspiring me to create a sort of storytime animation based off my games, so hopefully, that'll come to fruition eventually.I'll give an example based off the Egypt tomb experience:My protagonist is an OC named Serenity, and she's a museum curator who is hoping to preserve some ancient relics from a forbidden tomb. Her antagonist is a child spirit of chaos named ""Aggression"" and she's sort of the poltergeist of the tomb, setting off traps and leading people astray.My own game master character and my Shadow self created the labyrinth: myself creating the walls and rooms and the Shadow creating the traps and creatures. I already had a magic system in place for my characters, so being able toWe get pretty 4th-wall breaking, as in my own Mind Palace they're just playing the game, but it leads into a bigger story where the Shadow takes control of the game from me, and Serenity is solving puzzles and battling the undead....and that's where I'll leave off from there. I guess it also helps that I love world-building and the whole D&D creation aspect of everything really appeals to me.To those who didn't like the book, I strongly urge you to give it another chance, read through the rules and structures several times and work with them, and take the time and effort to craft your world in your head. It takes effort, yes, this is not just something you pick up and play immediately, but once the foundation is set, your games will be so immersive that it almost becomes second nature to you. Practice until something clicks, and try something different if you think that something doesn't work for you. This is your brain, and the book provides the guidelines for you to create your game world.100/10 book, would love to see you release another edition with some more of the games that weren't included, or at the very least I'd love to see you create a Corridor video with a full story and script that you write based off one of the games in this book.~ spywi's mind palace",5

It's 500 pages worth of emotion, terror, and great suspense. After reading the book, I compared it to the movie. There are certain things that are better in the book and better in the movie. The book hits the emotional level better since it talks about the struggles in the Torrance family. It delves into all of their lives more and you really feel for all of the characters. When they get to the hotel, they all seem happy, and that's when I really didn't want all of that bad stuff to happen, so when it happens, it's extremely suspenseful. The film version doesn't delve into the emotional factor enough. There also many different cool things that aren't it the movie, like the scrapbook of the history of the hotel, the wasps, their trips to Sidewinder, and the topiary animals (but I'm glad they didn't have the animals in the film). There are a lot of entertaining things in the book that aren't present in the film. The thing that's better in the film is the way they upgraded the terror. In one of the pivotal scenes in the book, when Jack appears behind Wendy and she hits him on the head with a wine bottle, they definitely made it more intense in the film, where instead she finds hundreds of papers with the line ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" and Jack creeps up behind her, where he follows Wendy up the stairs and she hits him on the head with a baseball bat, in a scene that lasts 10 minutes. It's by far my favorite scene in the movie and I was a little disappointed that it wasn't like that in the book, but there was a great build-up of suspense before that part in the book.The endings were different, and I don't know which one I liked better, but I can conclude I enjoyed the book probably just as much as the film. Even though the 1997 Mick Garris version probably sucks, I still am gonna see it soon. Altogether, this book was pure enjoyment from beginning to end. It's heartwarming, sad, suspenseful, and even though I knew what was going to happen, I was terrified. Stephen King wrote this book so uniquely and it's definitely the best book I've ever read!",5

Not great but still pretty good. All the characters had different voices, and when Jack Torrance gets angry the narrator really gives a great performance. I would say the production quality of this story was very good.Now the story is great, it's about a haunted hotel. A hotel with a very shady past and the ghosts seem to stick around. The hotel only really comes alive in the winter, on the anniversary of an old party that occurred many years ago that replays every year it seems. So during the summer months when this Colorado hotel is open everything seems normal, but when the hotel closes down for the winter that's when the hotel starts to get restless.In comes Jack Torrance and his family, and Jack really needs a job after getting fired from his teaching job after he got angry with a student. So the family moves to Colorado and the Overlook Hotel for the winter because of the money, and during this time Jack plans on finishing writing a play. Because of Jack's past anger problems he's a ripe vessel for the hotel to prey on.And what the Hotel wants is his son, Danny. Danny has The Shining, a special ability that allows him to read thoughts of others and even speak to others who have the shining. And because of this power the hotel wants to absorb it and gain more power.This is one of King's better stories, and it ends well, which can sometimes be a problem with King. This is an easily recommended story by King in fact it's one of the books to recommend for a new reader to King.

As this goes forth, I believe the reformation to the Universal Christ perspective will have far reaching impact that will unite people of various races, creeds, and cultures. A must read...",5

"2029","Pet Sematary: A Novel","One of the scariest books I've ever read","DPearl","198211598X","R3NXUVEV13PVF9","1555258666","I am one of those fans that believe that Stephen King's best work came between the late '70's and early '90's.  Pet Sematary might be the scariest book I've ever read because it is a believable horror story with excellent character development and invokes serious sympathy for the novel's main character, Louis Creed, who has just moved his family from Chicago to Ludlow, Maine, and takes a job at the university health center as the main doctor.Louis Creed, his wife Rachel, and his two kids, Ellie and Gage, along with Church, Ellie's beloved cat, realize this new home in Maine is the beginning of a new life.  They meet Jud, the neighbor across the ""road"", and he and Louis become pretty good friends and share many beers together.  One day Ellie notices a trail by their house that leads to what Jud calls the ""Pet Semetary,"" a place where kids have buried their pets who have been killed (usually by getting hit by a huge truck on the ""road"").Then while Rachel, Gage, and Ellie are visiting her parents, a trip that Louis does not make because of his disdain for Rachel's father, Church gets hit by a truck and Jud suggests they bury the cat before Ellie returns.  Except instead of burying him in the Pet Sematary, Jud introduces Louis to the Micmac burial grounds that is beyond the Pet Sematary, where they proceed to bury Church.But Church comes back, showing up a few days later to Louis' horror.  The cat appears the same, but is somehow different and smells like he just came from a grave.  However, Ellie comes back from Chicago and is really happy to see Church alive even though he really is different and smells really bad.A short time later tragedy strikes again when Gage is killed by a truck on the road and Louis decides to try burying him also in the Micmac burial grounds, whose ground is sacred and Jud has warned that people no matter what circumstance should never be buried there.  However, Louis is grief struck and ignores Jud's pleas and proceeds to bury Gage.  When Gage comes back, he is also different, and is no longer the same ""Gage"" but an evil three year old who wants nothing better than revenge.This book had me reading into the wee hours of the night and I honestly had to sleep with a night light on for a full six months after reading this book.  The movie, by the way, did the novel absolutely no justice.  The book is way better and significantly scarier.  If you like scary stories that are original and will stand the test of time, Pet Sematary is a great book.",5

Kelley","162860378X","R3MAHZZRT2B13H","1555258986","If this book is a starting point to encourage further research then this book serves its purpose.  As mentioned, Dr. Berry, offers no footnotes or links to research his information.  So do not take any of his claims as final truth.  If you research you will find contradicting studies and opinions all over that will likely lead you to throw your hands up in the air and get on with your life as usual.With that said, there are a few grammatical errors in this book, some explanations that seem a bit confusing or contradictory.  Although not really important, I agree with some of his positions because I have read some of the books he has mentioned and at length researched the info.Since I tend to be fairly balanced in my eating habits and don’t go to excess like consuming gallons of milk per week or eating a loaf of whole wheat bread every day or two then I’m not too concerned with what he has said about those products.  In my mind, research has yet to unequivocally resolve the milk/grain issue.  You’ll find contradicting info on this.  Weight has never been a problem for me like apparently it has been for Dr. Berry.  I don’t drink a lot of milk and I couldn’t care less that it’s not a good source of vitamin D any more than nutritional value of tea which I drink occasionally or beer for that matter.I enjoy my meat and am not afraid of saturated fats.  I agree with Dr. Berry’s position on this.  Cholesterol, well, that’s another story.  Few years ago I stopped taking my statins because of what I read in The Great Cholesterol Myth.  Now I have hypercholesterolemia, at least, the numbers indicate that.  Cholesterol is just one of many players in the atherosclerotic process, so, I wouldn’t throw it out with the bath water just yet.  This doctor and several others think they know the truth.  Do your research on this one and you’ll find maybe they are correct or maybe they aren’t.Anyway, I could continue but enough said for now.  Oh yeah, one other topic and that’s sun and skin cancer.  Again, with research I’m not totally convinced that there is NOT a link.  Some studies appear to show a correlation between UV rays and basal/squamous cell cancers and perhaps much less connection with melanomas.  Opposed to what Dr. Berry wrote there seems to be more of BC and SC cancers in sun exposed parts of the body than what he implied.",3

I have been obese my entire life and was always told the same thing, you need to eat less and eat more grains for fiber. The problem was, I wasn’t eating enough to engage my metabolism in the first place, so the doctors telling me to decrease what I already wasn’t eating, was not helping me at all. I’m 41 years old and never had any idea why I was obese, and every doctor that I went to kept trying to get me to go on Weight Watchers which I refused because I refuse to eat processed foods.

It was full of the usual hijinks with a baddie and plenty of mayhem.

Co-written by his son, Dirk Cussler, Clive is increasingly letting his legacy off to others. While I’m glad the series continues, there are some issues.

The biggest weak spot for me was the writing mechanics. While I had a great time and the story still contained all the trademarks I’ve loved since the beginning, this time, the point of view was more of an issue that usual. While Clive has always written in solid third-person, past-tense, he’s also been a bit loose with control of his characters. He’s head-hopped a bit, but not to the point where it was too jarring, at least that I can recall, since I learned to tell the difference.

In Celtic Empire, especially in the latter half of the book, there were several places where the point of view shifts without warning, and it was jarring. I had to stop reading, back up and go “what???” Then I figured out he was writing in another character’s head.

That head-hopping is one of my pet peeves and I was quite disappointed to see it so flagrant in this story. It was the one thing that detracted from an otherwise fun read.

I was still able to close the book with the usual smile on my face, but not without wondering what’s going to happen in future installments if things keep going this way.",5

By recognizing the harm caused by sticking with the standard of care even when the best designed studies show such care doesn’t work or worse is damaging to patients, doctors lose all credibility and the chance to help patients heal.  Sometimes their treatments in fact kill patients.The medical myths show several examples of harm from a system that fails to challenge its own dogmas even when good evidence shows those dogmas are wrong.  Also, we patients now have access to a wealth of medical knowledge via the internet and we see that often doctor doesn’t know best.  Patients need to persist in sharing knowledge with doctors both to bring our own treatment into the light and to hopefully become a team member with our doctors to return us to health.  If your doctor will not work with you fire him or her and find  a new one!I believe we are living through the dark ages of big pharma controlled medical education and that this cannot continue  much longer as the truth escapes and reveals the fallacy of a sick care rather than a health care based system.

Only after several chapters did it become clear to me that he's only dismissing exercise specifically for weight loss (he acknowledges the importance of exercise for other aspects of health) AND that he apparently makes a distinction between exercise that occurs in a gym and other forms of physical activity.  Yes, it is true that ""exercise"" in and of itself won't necessarily make you lose weight, but most people who are seeking to lose weight want to look better (not just weigh less) and exercise does contribute substantially to that goal.  It's also important to understand that doing some sorts of physical activity you enjoy gives you the same benefits that formal exercise in a gym setting does and the author is not recommending that you be sedentary.  While the clarifications later in the book are helpful, someone who quits reading after the first few chapters will likely be left with a very mistaken impression that exercise isn't important to health - and nothing could be further from the truth!Other than the exercise issue, I found the book to be full of practical health information that anyone can use - and can help them avoid the problems that can result from well-intended, but misguided, medical misinformation.",4

I loved the unrolling of the plot, so skillfully crafted with well-researched historical facts, and then, topped off with a very memorable main character that is written as the essence of intelligence, nuance and understatement.The story begins shortly after WWI, when the Bolsheviks have taken over the governance of the former Russian Empire.  An aristocrat is deemed a ""non-person"" and sentenced to the confines of Moscow's Metropol Hotel, rather than being stood against a wall and shot as a hated remnant of the privileged elite of last century Europe.  Without fuss or complaint, Count Rostov proudly removes himself and a few tokens of his family's past, from his suite of lavish hotel rooms, to a attic garrett, devoid of any hint of his past.  He makes do with his fate, believing that one must conquer one's situation, or else the situation will conquer him.As the months pass, the Count experiences many peaks and troughs of emotions and a deep sense of loss.  Then, quite by accident, Rostov befriends a half-grown, cheeky but intelligent girl who, along with her governess, is also trapped in the confines of the grand hotel, until another family member comes and takes her away to a new life, in the far reaches of the new state.  What the Count doesn't readily acknowledge is that little Nora becomes his savior, as she shows him how to double the size of his house arrest world, by giving him the master key to all the hidden hallways, cellars, storage rooms and passageways that only the hotel staff use.  Rostov soon masters his enlarged world, both physically and intellectually, and becomes one of the hotel staff, albeit still regarded by his colleagues as respected royalty.As the years and decades pass, Count Rostov accepts his fate and comes to enjoy his position as the head waiter and cuisine expert of the hotel.  His closest friends become the chef, the maitre'd and, later, Nina's  young daughter, Sophia, who is dropped off into the Count's care but remains with Rostov.  As time moves onward, the girl and the deposed aristocrat evolve into a small family with the other hotel staff as her beloved and attentive aunts and uncles.Sophia develops into a gifted pianist and wins prizes for her innate skill to bring much life to the works of the European master composers.  She wins a chance to perform in Paris, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the world outside of Moscow and the hotel, as well as a door to her future.  Knowing full well that the old aristocracy has been erased from his world forever, the Count uses his undiminished gifts of nuance and mastery of recognizing one's fate to change both Sophia's and his life forever.  It his greatest gamble in his long life and his master key to the future.Not only has the author captured a grand gentleman's life among the masses, Amor Towles uses captivating language and a myriads of plot developments to create a world special to old Moscow and those still caught between the past and the future of their nation.  True to the understated, elegant manner of the Count, the conclusion is masterfully under-stated and cleverly wrought.  I shall say no more.I can recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, superb language and a storyline that captivates and keeps the reader wanting more.",5

"2197","The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great","Intellectually honest Americans should consider Shapiro's thesis seriously.","WisconsinAlex","62857908","R1U57VUNDJJIT6","1555321764","Preliminary disclosure: my background is in academic ethics and mathematics. I'm Catholic, so I feel I don't have too much to say about the Judaic theological elements of this book. I read ancient Greek well enough to read the originally Greek parts of the Bible in its original language. My undergraduate thesis was about Aristotle's jurisprudential thought. After that, I'm fairly well-read in the various varieties of virtue ethics, both ancient and contemporary. This background is what informs my review.My review is not about the meritoriousness of his argument, but in a sense more about the rhetorical strategy Shapiro deploys. I do this because I think Shapiro has a defendable position which I think is wrong, but it's not obviously wrong. It's worthy of individual engagement and consideration, which I do not wish to taint for any reader.Review:Risking overstatement, Shapiro does a fairly good job at explaining a fairly nuanced thesis to a generalized audience. That said, I feel that this book will be non-dispositive to anybody who isn't inclined to agree with him. For example, in chapter 4, I was dismayed at the lack of engagment of the debates within Athenian thought about the nomos and logos. Chapter 4 especially seems to brush past fruitful nuance for the sake of making his argument seem almost tautologically self-evident. That lack of engagment might feel disingenuous, and therefore unworthy of meaningful consideration by Shapiro's interlocutors. Obviously, that dismissal on those grounds from a reader would be wrong-headed, but I think it's an important intellectual reality that isn't dealt with well. It makes Shapiro look like a Sophist and potentially unfairly maligns his position. Unfortunately, that non-nuanced sentiment seems to prevade the book more generally, excluding the introduction which I thought was well written. I know it's hard to condense several centuries of some of the world's best philosophical into a coherant ~200 pages, but I think Shapiro could have done a better job.The Right Side of History is de facto an important book because of it's massive audience. It needed to be readable for a global audience who is relatively ignorant of our intellectual roots/the discourse of which we are all a part. To that end, I commend Ben so much.Read this book if:1. You are a liberal arts-type person who might not currently take Shapiro seriously, but can entertain ideas without accepting them.2. You are interested in the loneliness epidemic in the West generally.Or3. You are concerned about the lack of engagement of classical ideas in contemporary society, but don't really know where to get started.Ending thoughts:I hope everyone who reads this book finds it as interesting as I did. I think the best way to do that is to honestly and genuinely step into Shapiro's world and allow yourself the liberty to think deeply about it. This does not mean accept it, unless it truly convinces you. I wrote this review on my phone while on a bus, sorry for the typos.",3

Michael Hyatt has given individuals a way to assess his/her productivity to really define and get clear on whether or not one should engage in certain tasks or find a way to delegate. Filled with exercises and tools, this is a super reference to help anyone reprioritize their focus to ensure that the important tasks are being accomplished based on what he/she values to gain more freedom. Reading this book helps to get one out of the mentality of “if I do more I will accomplish more and therefore be more productive.” Unlike some other books that address productivity, Mr. Hyatt has an affable, easy going writing style that reads like two friends having a conversation while breaking down the content into manageable bites. The best part is that this book makes creating a productivity habit easier to start and gives one the confidence to keep it up long term. I highly recommend.

"2247","After (The After Series)","Mixed Feelings","Mimi","1982111003","RC52R4TJ11LRJ","1555334562","I have very mixed feelings about this one. I first heard about it a few days before its release when several blogs I follow shared the preorder link. I thought it sounded interesting and I was intrigued by the fact that it was originally fanfiction. This book is a rollercoaster--there is ALWAYS some kind of drama. This makes the pacing good, but it's also annoying at times. Hardin's sweet on one page and a raging jerkwad on the next. Sometimes it's better to have some...build up instead of whiplash. So at times I found it very hard to like this book. I felt like it was the same drama over and over again with very little new information added to the story. My other biggest complaint is the writing...there are hardly any contractions which makes the dialogue way too formal and it doesn't read right. Also, it bugged me how Tessa has no friends. There's literally NO ONE she can go to. She's entirely dependent on Hardin. And normally I can overlook ""abusive"" relationships in fiction IF the guy can be redeemed, but there are no redeeming qualities in Hardin. He's definitely not on my ""book boyfriend"" list and I'm honestly shocked that this story is so popular. I wish I saw what other readers did, but all I saw was a strong girl get broken down by an abusive boy that wasn't worth her time. It did keep me entertained and I finished it, so props for that. I might read at least the next book in the hopes that Hardin can redeem himself, but I don't know if I really care enough to try.",3

In fact Hegland addresses the AI Church and religion issue as well -- the AI people want to have a Church of AI with an ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) as the godhead. A machine can be intelligent but not conscious as humans are. Then we have the issue of AI pretending to be human, invoking the Turing Test, and there is the fantasy of downloading memories and knowledge into a machine -- without programming. Ain't gonna happen, and Hegland explains why... he takes a more metaphysical approach and equates the deeper findings of Quantum Physics with the TAO in Eastern teachings. ""Consciousness"" in a machine would have to be programmed to simulate it, and again we are dealing with simulation -- even the knowledge and memories would all have to be programmed.
He flat out says that consciousness is of the soul and machines do not have it (p. 281).

As for Simulation, he brings the info up to date, annoying people who do not like to hear that we are in what seems to be the Great Simulation. The reality we live in is quantized (according to Quantum Physics) which means digital and that means somewhere, someone is simulating this Reality. And this gets into what Dr Bostrom said earlier that we could be simulated consciousness in this Realm (p. 281) .... but it goes beyond that and the Simulation involves Karma, Reincarnation and soul growth (p. 285) -- which is exactly what Hegland examines in depth, and goes beyond Simulation to why we are here and what we are. .. and that pushes a new understanding of Man and this Realm, bordering on a new Faith.",5

This is the story of a band in the late 70's and their rise to fame, the main characters of the novel are telling the story of the bands rise and fall, years later. It's very raw and addictive.What I Loved: The way this book is written in such a unique format and just pulls you in because of its unique format. The story of a band rising to fame is fascinating in itself, but the format really assists. Also, the characters are so interesting and even when they're unlikeable, you can't help but hope they pull themselves together. It felt really realistic, and the stories felt like they could be happening. Also, the ending is just super shocking and I really needed to sit with it.What I didn’t like so much: I can't really think of much that I didn't like. This was a really great book and it didn't hold any punches. Sometimes the drugs could be a lot but it was also important to the book.Who Should Read It: People who love classic rock. People who love 'behind the scenes' type book. People who love realistic characters. Anybody, really.General Summary: The behind the music in book form of a classic rock band, where the characters are real and cheerworthy.",5

After finally purchasing this book and diving in, I was kinda bummed and looked around the room after finishing thinking, ""what the heck was that""?! Although the chemistry between Tessa and Hardin was interesting, I don't get how a book can be 600 pages and literally nothing happens in the plot other than class occasionally, parties, fighting, drinking... and sex. I mean, literally nothing. At certain points in the book, it was just redundant, and I started to count how many times the author wrote that Tessa snapped back at Hardin. Too many snaps my friend... too many. It also bothers me that this author took too many character life descriptions and sub-plot points from other novels... like Fifty Shades of Grey, Bared to You, and Beautiful Disaster. I realize this was fan fiction, but it read very familiar in some points of the book. But after the entire book I do have to say the ending was kind of a shocker and very climactic, and when it comes down to it I'm a sucker for sequels. So even with all the Tessa ""snap backs"" and no real plot line, I'll probably read the next book.",3

But not for the Fainthearted Environmentalist","Jazzman","1631494023","R2JRRA7DLFXQNV","1555350141","""The Gulf"" is a lengthy work on one of the world's great natural resources. Davis covers all aspects of this American sea: cultural history, natural history, ecology, and destruction. The history is first rate as he discusses the Gulf's exploration by Europeans and their interactions with the indigenous populations. The natural history is wonderful, too, as Davis describes the birds, fish, mollusks, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals that inhabit the Gulf's varied ecological zones. He concludes the book with a lengthy description of how mankind has abused the Gulf, its estuaries, and the rivers that feed it. This last section is not for the fainthearted environmentalist as case study after case study is presented describing over-fishing, pollution by the petrochemical industries, and deluges of poisonous run-off from agribusiness and suburbia. The Gulf as it exists today is probably moribund. I can't see how this body of water can sustain such disregard forever. Nor does the author, evidently, as his concluding chapter ends pessimistically. Given that a majority of the natives of the Gulf states abhor environmentalists and government - and greatly support the current administration's anti-environmental agenda - there's no hope or reason to think that the residents of the Gulf care about its health and sustainability.

The writing is overall very good though there are sections that have a ""cobbled-together"" feel to them. I could have used a few more maps as the author hops around the Gulf in his discussion quite a bit. And a few more photos from days-gone-by would have been fun. Highly recommended for fans of American natural history. Recommended for everyone else.",5

While it does include a TON of practical, actionable, step-by-step ideas for how to become more productive and efficient, it lays them on a much deeper foundation. Michael's book asks you to connect with why productivity matters in the first place, and, why it's important to you.

Also, the message isn't simply, 'Do more in less (or the same) time' by trying these 10 tips, tricks and hacks. We all know that doesn't really work... for more than a week, anyway.

Instead, Michael also asks us to examine what we need to stop, eliminate, automate and delegate. Over the long haul, these suggests are not only going to save me a ton of time, but also help ensure that I'm doing the right things, and investing in the right relationships.

The step-by-step action guides at the end of each chapter and free tools that come with the book are very helpful in implementing the book. Which, of course, is the whole point.

I will say that thoughtful Christians (I'm aspiring to be) may find that they need to buttress some of the book with even deeper foundations. I.e., to tap into God's agenda most deeply, to pray through the material and exercises, to recognize that their own (and others') brokenness will make it harder to implement this than they anticipated, and so on. That said, there's nothing here that can't fit into a framework of faith, and Michael himself is a devoted follower of Christ.

All in all, this book is the best resource I've found in helping me pursue the kind of intentionality and focus that I'm continually aiming to improve. Especially for the price, purchasing and working through this is a no-brainer.",5

In their writings, many authors failed to address the struggles that minorities face in their journey to success. If you want to understand your roadblocks as a minority leader, you need to read this book. You cannot fight if you do not know what you are fighting against. The norm says to be successful you need an education and others say you need more than talents, but Stacey Abrams tell you through her experience as a minority leader and her remarkable writing skills precisely what you need to know to succeed as a minority leader. If you were about to give up because what you have read thus far does not seem to be helpful before you throw the towel give ""Minority leader"" a chance.",5

Willis","0801075262","R1EE2VWLVT6UQ6","1555356040","I wanted to read Michael Hyatt's ""Free to Focus"" because I was at a crossroads with my productivity. My first lesson when reading the book was that my goal wasn't to learn to work faster so I could add more work. No, it was about blending my purpose, passion, and priorities. I changed my WHY for being more productive.

When I'm free to focus, I can choose the best tasks and not only do them well, but be efficient so there is margin for other priorities in my life.

I especially like the charts and exercises in each chapter to help me sort it all out. I've already implemented some changes based on what I've learned about myself in the book.

I highly recommend the book to anyone who wants to evaluate and rearrange life goals and break them down into doable tasks while leaving room for meaningful extras.

My youngest child just started college this year, so my husband and I are empty nesters. I had a job that I loved and was fully committed to it. It fulfilled me and brought great joy, and then two years ago, I was fired. I spent quite a while wondering just what was going on and what I was going to do now. Fast forward to today, and I'm still working on that process.Girl, Stop Apologizing isn't what it appears on the surface. I started reading thinking it was going to be uplifting and encouraging me not to say ""I'm sorry"" so much and to have the self-esteem to own my choices. In a way, that's what this book is about, but it's really so much more.This is a book about peeling away the excuses and figuring out how to turn your dreams and goals into reality. Yes, her writing style is a bit loose, some parts are braggy and unnecessary, some of the things are out of my reach practically, and there's a bit of repetition from Girl, Wash Your Face: but there's so much to learn and embrace in this book. It's empowering and uplifting while also providing tools and ideas for propelling you forward into a more fulfilling and joyful existence.I finally feel like I can see the beginnings of new goals and new dreams for my future, and it's exciting to imagine!I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.",4

Scratch that, I almost didn't even make it past 10% of the book. My thoughts during those times? I thought everyone was over dramatic and overreacted over everything. Oh yeah, Hardin was an a*hole and not the endearing kind and Tessa was an obsessed little virgin. Let me explain, I felt like she thought about him every other sentence of the book. We get it, Hardin has tattoos, piercings, and is hot as h***. But when did that ever become an excuse to be a d***?So I still kind of think those things but guess what? I kept on reading and I couldn't stop. And more importantly, I didn't want to. Hardin would show me pieces of himself that made me care for him and Tessa grew trough the novel. I didn't think she was as naive anymore towards the end. Sitting in bed was ALL I wanted to do but I have a life I have to live...and kids that are too young to feed themselves.During the night when I would get my reading done, I would be talking to the characters, laughing at them, and cussing them out. Yes, I talk to my kindle. I would giggle like a school girl in the most inappropriate times. Is this really one direction fan fic?! To answer my own question, yes, yes it is. Thank god I didn't picture them while I was reading though. That's pretty much why I've put off reading it for so long.You guys have all read the synopsis so I won't waste your time with summarizing the book. All I know is that it was full of angst and borderline dysfunctional people. Like for real...it's not borderline, it's full on dysfunction. They spend most of the book getting mad and yelling over stupid s***. It wasn't just one either, both of them were very irrational but weirdly, that's what made me like them. I hate books that have overdramatize characters but I if its written well, I can handle it.It was very tough for me to put the book down. I'm glad I took the chance to read this. I'm already on book 2 and plan to get the rest. This is definitely my guilty pleasure read. If we're wondering if you should pick this up or not, I suggest you do. So what if one direction was behind the inspiration? Just picture your own characters and go into this with an open mind.",4

Take all these storylines and throw in the fact that Throe is still up to no good and wants to take the crown from Wrath, the vampire king, and you have the complex culmination that J R Ward is famous for! It's brilliant the way all of this chaos and heartache renders a sweet love story and helps to heal wounds that are soul deep and so terrible that they shape who the characters are today.",5

He confronts Paige and Aaron one day and goes viral for attacking Aaron. Three months later, Aaron is dead, Paige is missing and Simon will do whatever it takes to find and save his daughter.
OK, so I confess, I may have been biased starting this book because Harlan Coben is MY FAVORITE AUTHOR EVER. I mean, I fan girl over him like teens did over the Beatles and Elvis back in the day. So I pretty much knew I would enjoy this as I have enjoyed every book previously. He never disappoints! This was a fast-paced thriller than included his usual snark and wit. He always brings the characters and story lines together brilliantly. READ THIS BOOK (AND ANYTHING ELSE BY COBEN) - you won't be disappointed!!!!

Bennett","198211598X","R37BB5QVH6N5A5","1555361485","**This review is a comparison of the book and the movie (with Nicholson and Duvall). The reason is for ones like me that saw the movie and wasn't sure why they would need to read the book.** I love reading Stephen King though I admit I have a lot more books of his to read. I tend to pass over his books that were turned to movies since I initially know what they are about. Same with this book. My decision to read it was because he came out with Doctor Sleep which is a follow up to The Shining. I was told by a few who read the book and seen the movie that they are not quite the same. So I jumped into this one so I could read Doctor Sleep (all the time thinking it might be a waste of time though). I was wrong! Though I do love Stanley Kubrick's movie, I could also see why King was disappointed with it. There is so much more depth in the book (which there almost always is). But this was to a point you could almost understand the madness that Jack went through (unlike the movie where he pretty much seemed like a jerk  from the beginning). The book shows his love for his family and his family's love for him. His son idolizes him to the point it almost makes Wendy jealous. This is not something that is shown in the movie. I believe it is a big factor. It shows how strong these ""ghosts"" were to tear Jack down like that. There are also differences like Wendy's description is nothing like Shelley Duvall, the relationship between Danny and Dick Halloran is more intense in the book, and the ending was totally different. Even with all of that, I still love the movie but now I can say I love the book as well for the same and different reasons.",5

I'm a 54 year old woman (previously divorced) and I found this book delightful and think it is great for people of all ages - especially younger people. If you have watched LPBW you have probably felt connected to their family and have only wished the best things for them. This is an honest & personal account of Jeremy and Audrey's love story - it is joyful, sad, painful, exciting, passionate, fearful, embarrassing, and so much more!!! I got renewed in tips to make my relationship with my husband better - over the years I can see how I have become complacent, less attentive, less supportive, etc. I'm so happy for them & excited at the success of this book. All ages need more role models like Jeremy & Audrey - society is saturated with people with no morals or integrity. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK & LOVE THEIR OTHER BUSINESS VENTURES TOO!!!",5

"2522","Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the…","Cracking read on the history of coders, coding and software ... and their future","Aran Joseph Canes","0735220565","R1BG7R514F4JNJ","1555365558","As a former tech reporter myself, and--full disclosure--a friend of the author, I'm predisposed to like this book. However, even were I not, Coders resonates as a necessary book for our current moment.

At no other time in recent history has software and the people who make it been more critical to how we experience the world. Thanks to the current ""pics or it didn't happen"" mentality, Thompson's talent at digging into the personalities and the quirks of the mostly men (and the few women) who write the code that we rely on to stay in touch with loved ones, share experiences, shop, consume media, etc., should make readers to think about how the foundations of so much of daily life are produced.

He deftly exhumes the history of the software industry from its early days when coding was considered secretarial labor (and thus left to the ladies) to today's more male-dominated environment, where software bros chase the big score. He asks the right questions: Why did this happen and what was the effect of that shift? What are the knock-on impacts when coders are overwhelmingly white (or Asian), male, and convinced of their own overweening intelligence? Is the current, toxic environment found online solely because humans can be pretty awful to one another? Or is it because the guys who coded the platform just didn't think about online abuse because they never had to? Did that ignorance lead them to unwittingly enable the abuse, fake news, and mob culture we now have to endure? Thompson convincingly argues that a fair amount of that ignorance is at fault.

Ultimately, code doesn't just happen; humans with their weirdo attitudes, biases, ideologies, and faults write it, and they tend to encode into the code itself those very same attitudes, biases, ideologies, and faults -- whether they mean to or not. That's why it's important to understand the history of coders and the code they write. Given how important software is to the modern world -- a glitch at one airport can disrupt airline traffic all over the world, just to name one recent example -- we also have to know who the authors are.

Thompson's book does that, and with a verve, style, and brisk pace that makes Coders a readable, engaging, and valuable addition to this field of study.",4

If you have any kind of dream - big or small - from starting a new career to getting your home more organized - there’s information in this book for you. The most difficult but also necessary part of this book is that it calls out all the excuses that get in the way of women reaching their goals - and by calling them out, they can start to lose their power.

This book was really something. I won't get into the plot because there's already a good enough summary for the description but this book is powerful stuff. It's extremely dark, disturbing, rich, almost unbearably intense, terrifying, nightmare inducing, emotionally draining and very depressing. The entire story has a gloomy cloud constantly hanging over it dealing with a fixation on death, loss, grief, inability to cope with loss and sadness that's uncomfortable but also very rich on an emotional level. It may sound like I'm giving a negative review of the book but I'm not. It's a brilliant book but it is also everything else I've mentioned as well. It's very strong.

"2625","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Pet Semitary","scott Thompson","198211598X","R2IM8BWEMLQ4FQ","1555374047","In Pet Semitary Stephen King uses many different literary devices, but one that stands out the most is foreshadowing. In the novel John and his family move into a new house and meet some interesting neighbors across the street. They tell him about a trucking company that used to drive through the neighborhood all the time and would end up hitting the people's pets. The kids took their pets to a field after they got hit and bury them giving it the name Pet Semitary. John's daughter terry owns a cat and they talked about how in their old house they were secluded and the cat didn't have to worry about crossing the street and getting hit. Stephen King foreshadows the cat getting hit by a car because their new neighbors were warning them about keeping their cat inside as much as possible because animals always seem to get hit on the street they live on.The author, Stephen King, also foreshadows the animals coming back to life. The neighbor said that he herd of peoples pets coming back and haunting them, almost like a revenge for not keeping them safe and that is why people keeping moving in and out of that house. All of the previous owners pets are still in the house haunting it and when the cat gets hit and comes back with the other animals it is expected. I just knew that they were going to come and haunt the family because of the foreshadowing.Stephen King also uses personification in his novel Pet Semitary. When the animals come back to haunt the house he has them talking to each other. They also talk to John and his family and their cat especially because it yells at the family and writes messages on the wall. This is personification because the animals are given human characteristics. Not only do the animals talk and write they are also organized like a group of humans would be organized. This isn't completely personification but the way they are acting is much like a human therefore making them different then just animals.",4

"2631","Kushner, Inc.: Greed. Ambition. Corruption. The Extraordinary Story of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump","AN INFORMATIVE BOOK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT’S DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW","Steven H Propp","1250185947","RKO1I1V6NRBS1","1555374646","Author Vicky Ward wrote in the Prologue to this 2019 book, “Donald Trump… was celebrating being sworn in as president… And the whole world knew that his daughter and son-in-law were his most trusted advisers, ambassadors, and coconspirators. They were an attractive couple---extremely wealthy and, now, extraordinarily powerful. Ivanka looked like Cinderella… Ivanka and her husband swept onto the stage, deftly deflecting attention from Donald Trump’s clumsy moves, as she had done do often over the past twenty years. The crowd roared in approval… They were now America’s prince and princess.”She notes, “Jared Kushner learned about the company [his father’s] he would later run. Jared was the firm’s most sheltered trainee. On his summer vacations, he’d go to work at Kushner Companies construction sites, maybe painting a few walls, more often sitting and listening to music… No one dared tell him this probably would not give him a deep understanding of the construction process. But Charlie [Jared’s father] doggedly groomed his eldest son for greatness, seeing himself… as a Jewish version of Joseph Kennedy…” (Pg. 17-18)She states, “Ivanka had to fight for her father’s attention and her ultimate role as the chief heir in his real estate empire… When Donald Trump divorced her mother, Ivana… she would go out of her way to see more of her father, not less… she’d call him during the day… and to her delight, he’d always take her call. (Trump’s relationship with the two sons he had with Ivana, Don Jr. and Eric, was not nearly so close for years.) ‘She was always Daddy’s little girl,’ said… a family friend.” (Pg. 32-33) She adds, “As Ivanka matured, physically and emotionally, her father talked openly about how impressed he was with her appearance---a habit he has maintained to this day.” (Pg. 35)She recounts, “at a networking lunch thrown by a diamond heir… Jared was introduced to Ivanka … Jared and Ivanka quickly became an intriguing gossip column item. They seemed perfectly matched… But after a year of dating, they split… in part because Jared’s parents were … dismayed at the idea of their son marrying outside the faith… Soon after, Ivanka agreed to convert to Judaism… Trump was said to be discombobulated by the enormity of what his daughter had done. Trump, a Presbyterian, who strikes no one as particularly religious, was baffled by his daughter’s conversion… ‘Why should my daughter convert to marry anyone?’” (Pg. 51-53)She observes, “Ivanka Trump was critical in promoting her husband as the smoother, softer counterpart to his father’s volatility.. they could both work a room, ask after people’s children, talk without notes, occasionally fake a sense of humor… And unlike her husband, she seemed to have a ready command of figures and a detail, working knowledge of all the properties she was involved in… Ivanka seemed to control the marital relationship, but she also played the part of devoted, traditional Orthodox wife.” (Pg. 70-71)Of 2016, she states, “No one thought Kushner or Ivanka believed in Trump’s populist platform. ‘The two of them see this as a networking opportunity,’ said a close associate. Because Kushner and Ivanka only fully immersed themselves in Trump’s campaign once he became the presumptive Republican nominee… they had to push to assert themselves with the campaign staff… Kushner quickly got control of the campaign’s budget, but he did not have as much authority as he would have liked.” (Pg. 74-75) She adds, “Ivanka appeared thrilled by her husband’s rising prominence in her father’s campaign. It was a huge change from the days when Trump had made belittling jokes about him. If Don Jr. and Eric were irked by the new favorite in Trump’s court, they did not show it publicly.” (Pg. 85)She points out, “Trump tweeted an image [Hillary with a backdrop of money and a Star of David] widely viewed as anti-Semitic… an ‘Observer’ writer, criticized Kushner in his own newspaper for standing ‘silent and smiling in the background’ while Trump made ‘repeated accidental winks’ to white supremacists… Kushner wrote a response… [that] insisted that Trump was neither anti-Semitic nor a racist… Not all of Kushner’s relatives appreciated his efforts to cover Trump’s pandering to white supremacists.” (Pg. 86-87) Later, she adds, “U.S.-Israel relations was the one political issue anyone in the campaign ever saw Kushner get worked up about.” (Pg. 96)On election night, “Kushner was shocked that Trump never mentioned him in his speech and would later tell people he felt slighted. He was going to find a way to get Trump to notice him more… Ivanka would help him… the couple would become known as a single, powerful entity: ‘Javanka.’” (Pg. 101) She suggests, “Kushner was increasingly caught up in his own mythology. He was the president’s son-in-law, so he apparently thought he was untouchable.” (Pg. 114) She notes, “allowing Kushner to work in the administration… broke with historical precedent, overruling a string of Justice Department memos that … concluded it was illegal for presidents to appoint relatives as White House staff.” (Pg. 119)She observes, “Those first few days were chaotic for almost everyone in the new administration. A frantic Reince Priebus would quickly discover that it was impossible to impose any kind of order in this White House, in large part because Trump didn’t like order. What Trump liked was having people fight in front of him and then he’d make a decision, just like he’d made snap decisions when his children presented licensing deals for the Trump Organization. This kind of dysfunction enabled a ‘floater’ like Kushner, whose job was undefined, to weigh in on any topic in front of Trump and have far more influence than he would have had in a top-down hierarchy.” (Pg. 125)She recounts, “Another epic [Steve] Bannon/Ivanka fight came when bannon was in the Oval Office dining room while Trump was watching TV and eating his lunch… Ivanka marched in, claiming Bannon had leaked H.R. McMaster’s war plan… [Bannon said] ‘No, that was leaked by McMaster…’ Trump [told her], ‘Hey, baby, I think Steve’s right on this one…’ Bannon thought he would be fired on the spot… But he’d learned something important: much as Trump loved his daughter and hated saying no to her, he was not always controlled by her.” (Pg. 138-139)She notes, “[Ivanka] also found a way to be near Trump when he received phone calls from foreign dignitaries---while she still owned her business… While Ivanka’s behavior was irritating, Kushner was playing a game on a whole different level: he was playing for serious money… at the time of the Qatari blockade… Kushner’s family had been courting the Qataris for financial help and had been turned town. When that story broke … the blockade and the Trump administration’s response to it suddenly all made sense.” (Pg. 156)Arguing that “Kushner was behind the decision to fire [FBI Director James] Comey” (Pg. 163-164), “Quickly, Trump realized he’d made an error, and blamed Kushner… It seemed clear to Trump’s advisers, and not for the first time, that he wished Kushner were not in the White House. He said to Kushner in front of senior staff, ‘Just go back to New York, man…’” (Pg. 167) She adds, “[Ivanka’s] reluctance to speak frankly to her father was the antithesis of the story she had been pushing in the media… Ivanka had told Gayle King… ‘Where I disagree with my father, he knows it. And I express myself with total candor.’” (Pg. 170)She states, “at the Group of 20 summit in Germany… she briefly took her father’s seat when he had to step out… The gesture seemed to send the message that the U.S. government was now run on nepotism.” (Pg. 182)E-mails from George Nader [an adviser to Shiekh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi] “made it clear that Kushner’s friends in the Gulf mocked him behind his back… Nader wrote… ‘Nobody would even waste a cup of coffee on him if it wasn’t for who he was married to.’” (Pg. 206)She points out, “since October 2017, hundreds of children had been taken from their parents while attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border and detained separately… news shows everywhere showed heartbreaking images of young children being detained. The next month, Ivanka posted on Instagram a photograph of herself holding her youngest child… in his pajamas. Not for the first time, her tone-deaf social media post was slammed as being isolated in her elitist, insulated wealthy world… On June 20, Trump signed an executive order that apparently ended the border separations. Minutes later, Ivanka finally spoke publicly on the issue… Her tactic here was… tell the public you care about an issue; watch silently while your father does the exact opposite; and when he moves a little, take all the credit.” (Pg. 225)She asserts, “Kushner’s friendship with a Saudi crown prince was now under widespread scrutiny… [because] Rather than expressing moral outrage over the cold-blooded murder of an innocent man [Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi], Kushner did what he always does in a crisis: he went quiet.” (Pg. 232)She concludes, “Ivanka Trump has made no secret of the fact that she wants to be the most powerful woman in the world. Her father’s reign in Washington, D.C., is, she believes, the beginning of a great American dynasty… Ivanka has been carefully positioning herself as [Trump’s] political heir…” (Pg. 236)While not as “scandalous” as the book’s subtitle might suggest, this is a very interesting book that will be of great interest to those wanting information about these crucial members of the Trump family and presidency.",5

First problem: the 100% predictable storyline. There are NO surprises whatsoever, but there are  any number of situations that strain credulity. For example, it is extremely unlikely that a college freshman would be assigned a sophomore dorm-mate, but especially one with NO common intetests.  Co-ed floor bathrooms at a state u? Very unusual, too.  Three (+) blowout parties a week at a single fraternity house with underage  drinking and drugs wouldn't go unnoticed in thisvday/age, (etc.) There's too much fantasy college and ""Animal House"" stereotyping here, and nothing resembling reality.Secondly, the ""romance"" is not at all romantic. There is abusive, manipulative, jealous be havior at every turn. No one can talk like an adult - they just curse, scream, cry, and sob. Still, we are supposed to believe there is great understanding and a deep respect/love between two (damaged) people. Not that we ever get to read anything indicative of this, other than eventual trite declarations of ""I love you"" and repetitive decriptions of (unimaginative) basic sexual techniques for teens. (Ho hum.)But truly, the worst is that when it finally seems like thete is acyually an interesting development in the story -- it would be hard to say it is a ""plot"" -- the book simply QUITS.  There is no denouement, because the author, after this volume of 580 pages, has a further FOUR ADDITIONAL BOOKS to sell (at $11.99 each) to ostensibly complete the ""series."" It'd be nice to COMPLETE one story before setting out to write four companion volumes -  If it really takes 2500 pages to tell this tale, then I do not want to read it.",1

"2693","Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder","Deserved its Pulitzer","M Arneson","1627792767","R2W3WY5FNAR4I0","1555379237","Even though this book deals with circumstances that occurred more than 100 years ago, it is timely in many ways--especially given the fires in California. This book depicts, for example, how Westward movement created environmental destruction that led to the Dust Bowl. The book also shines light on political dynamics around resistance to the New Deal that I found fascinating (and frustrating). And of course there is the truth of what westward expansion did to the indigenous people, much of which I already knew, but the way it is contextualized in this book is powerful. For example, one of the first ""little houses on the prairie"" was not built by Pa Ingalls but was a house belonging to an Indian family that had gone hunting. This was an illegal practice many pioneers established: stealing not just Indians' land but their actual dwellings.

All of this historical background is woven into the story of the life of Laura Ingalls Wilder. The ""half-pint"" of the TV show and books IS and IS NOT the true Laura, whose life was one of harsh struggle and deep loss. One thing I was surprised to learn was that her family never was able to support themselves as small famers (true for most)--and as a girl she had to help support the family by working.

I also hadn't realized she had a hell-on-wheels daughter--nor that she didn't start writing until her sixties. It was the popularity of her books that finally provided her with some financial stability.

The scope of this book is fascinating. I understand why it won the Pulitzer.",4

"2727","Eat Clean, Play Dirty: Recipes for a Body and Life You Love by the Founders of Sakara Life","Simply love this book, the recipes and the creativity. Cannot wait to keep preparing these dishes!","LISA","1419734733","R8RNEK72O0OMR","1555382753","I have tried some of the Sakara products but not their meal delivery plan as its not exactly conducive for a whole family nor someone that travels as much as I do; so the chance to replicate their clean eating recipes for the bargain price of this book was a compelling reason to purchase!

This book is, quite frankly amazing. If you own many plant based books, you will quickly begin to recognize the same recipes replicated over and over again with maybe tiny tweaks to make them unique. This is certainly not the case in this book - the recipes are largely unique, and kudos for the fact that the vast majority of the ingredients are things you could find in any major supermarket. The book is also bright, fresh and full of colorful pictures of the featured dishes.

Its part story book and pa recipe book as it begins with the authors stories, the story behind Sakara and some basic detail about the ""eat clean, play dirty"" mantra.....which just note, you will need to be a lover of your greens as this lifestyle emphasizes six to eight cups of greens a day but does come full of suggestions to getting them into your diet.

The chapters then include breakfast, lunch, dinner, dressings, desserts and cocktails . There are so many enticing recipes. Nothing too complicated and most if not all can be accomplished without necessitating expensive equipment or crazy amounts of prep time.

I plan on routinely making the Green bars - packed with seeds, sweetened with fruit and taken up a notch with Chlorella. The salads will be my go to this summer and both the salads and home made dressings are very easy to prepare. I love the Taco salad with Walnut Chorizo as it avoids using fake meats and ups the protein with the nuts. The Red Beet burgers are almost a make your own ""Beyond Meat"" burger and pretty simple to prepare.

There are some heavier main meals which would be ideal for the cooler weather and a wide range of desserts and the strawberry 'Chia-sicles' will be a go to for me as we are already hitting 90 degrees and what a neat way to keep the kids healthy. It ends with some beautiful cocktails which will be perfect for the upcoming summer months!

Simply love this book, the recipes and the creativity. Cannot wait to keep preparing these dishes!",5
"2730","When We Left Cuba","Suspenseful and romantic","Rachel M","045149086X","R2FXGQFPYGGT99","1555383019","I fell in love with Next Year In Havana telling anyone and everyone that they had to read it. At the end of it was a little snippet from Beatriz's perspective that kind of dropped a bombshell on readers. Waiting for an entire year to get the whole story was not easy but it was so worth it!

Where Next Year In Havana played on nostalgia, When We Left Cuba is all about malcontent followed by action. Beatriz was never satisfied being a socialite and behaving like a proper lady - much to her mother's chagrin - in the hopes of capturing a husband. It wasn't what she enjoyed doing in Cuba either and it certainly is not something she likes doing in America even if means securing her status here. Her end goal has always been to go back home. America is a temporary stop. Most of her passion and hatred for Castro is fueled by her twin brother's murder at the hands of the man who controls her beloved country. She has deigned to take on her brother's mantel and work with rebels who seek to depose Castro. It's a dangerous road to go down on but Beatriz has never been a rule follower and signs on to work covertly with the CIA. She's not going to sit idly by while her country suffers. In a case of bad timing, Beatriz has attracted the attention of a young US senator, Nicholas ""Nick"" Preston whose star is on the rise. Only he's spoken for but it doesn't stop those longing gazes and brief stolen moments they steal for themselves.

There's a recurring theme throughout the novel (other than Castro must go) and it's Beatriz's determination to not be defined by the men in her life. She adamantly refuses to be controlled by anyone and demands to be seen as an equal capable of making her own decisions and taking on danger should she choose to do so. There's also a relative amount of suspense considering the espionage and political climate of the era, and she finds herself in the midst of some incredibly sensitive or volatile situations. Her affair with Nick provides a counterbalance to all the plotting she gets embroiled in. Their contrasting perspectives on Cuba and the American government's involvement are the constant background to their own drama.

At some point Beatriz's fierce declarations of revenge against Castro become repetitive but it's also understandable. Her body is in Palm Beach but her heart is in Cuba so she's never felt truly at home in America. She feels displaced and helpless, so her anger is what she can hold on to to give her purpose. Granted, she and her family are financially in far better shape than many of their countryman who escaped. I think she comes to realize it as time wears on and she sees how in some ways she was insulated from what a lot of Cubans faced.

Cleeton's writing evokes the glamourous and tense atmosphere of that era. She had me envisioning the vibrant settings and sounds, and more than that, she gave me a history lesson. What I knew of the Cold War was solely from history class and honestly, I don't remember much of it. What she's done here is personalize these events, seeing them through the eyes of those displaced by the revolution. I remember from Next Year in Havana the mention of a sense of heavy guilt for leaving and also for not staying to fight. Cleeton made these challenges personal and reminded me of the people who were affected, whose lives were uprooted and who had to lay down new roots uncertain of what the future would hold, uncertain of whether to call America home or hold out hope that they would go home.

This woman savagely murdered several people, including young Jewish children out by a lake after feeding them a warm meal. The Huntress proves difficult to find - it’s as though she disappeared after the war without a trace.Joining Ian and Tony is Nina, a former aviatrix who had come into contact with The Huntress’s brutality first hand. Nina is the only one of her victims to escape alive.An ocean away in Boston, Jordan McBride is an avid photographer with big dreams. When her widowed father brings home a new woman, Anneliese, for Jordan to meet, she doesn’t have a good feeling about her. Suspicions are confirmed when Jordan snaps a candid photo of her - the shot reveals a look that means nothing other than hidden secrets.This novel hooked me right from the start! Early on it’s clear to readers who The Huntress is, but to me the real thrill was waiting to find out when and how she’d be revealed.

"2746","Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder","Extremely detailed","M Arneson","1627792767","R1W1MB0Z44U2HJ","1555385317","I grew up reading the Little House on the Prairie (LHOP) books and watching the TV series. To me, Melissa Gilbert was Laura Ingalls Wilder and Michael Landon, Charles. Melissa and I were born a month apart, Laura and I both clumsy compared to our more perfect siblings both facts made my kinship with LIW feel even more real.

When PRAIRIE FIRES was on a one day Kindle sale for $2.99, I grabbed the Pulitzer Prize winning biography, expecting an adult experience like I had with Little House. I knew LIW factionalized her experiences in the LHOP books and even more so in the TV series. I hoped for at the very least an interesting account of Wilder’s life.

Caroline Fraser’s exhaustive research left no minor detail unwritten. I found myself skimming over census data, great grandparents and even ancestry dating back to a Salem witchcraft hysteria victim. Fraser’s frequent tangents, which important if I was studying the LIW in a historical context, mostly didn’t interest me. Salem was a sidestep that did interest me, weather statistics, blights and locusts, not so much.

PRAIRIE FIRES is over 600 pages, including references and pictures. I would have preferred a 200 page narrative nonfiction about LIW’s life. Laura’s childhood interested me most, particularly seeing how her real life diverged from fiction. I enjoyed reading about the real people in different areas the Ingalls had lived and remembering their fictional versions.

While reading, I wondered how much Fraser’s own opinions influenced her narrative, particularly around Laura’s jealousy of Mary, which to Fraser seemed slightly pathological and to me seemed like typical sibling rivalry. I also wondered if LIW’s daughter Rose Wilder Lane was as horrible as she seemed to be.

PRAIRIE FIRES isn’t the story of Laura Ingalls Wilder’s life I would have told, but I was also impressed with how Fraser brought historical, cultural and biological information into the book. I didn’t enjoy reading PRAIRIE FIRES, but I’m glad I read the story, if that makes sense.",4

"2749","Top 10 Games You Can Play In Your Head, By Yourself: Second Edition","Fantastic! My Imagination Is On Fire!","L.Newman","998379417","R2P0NTZBQG93C8","1555385655","Whoa! I’m amazed. This book has lit my imagination on fire! These games are so much fun. I’m currently playing through ‘Adventure’ I’ll try an explain what I’ve been through so far.So, it all started with me, Shawn Weston, as a child, I was at my friend’s house for a sleep over, one morning we woke up and I forgot to remind my friend to take his vitamin for the day. He died in the next few hours. On that day I vowed to never let anyone suffer like that again. Flash forward to today, Cairo 1940. I read in an Encyclopedia Britannica that Egyptian god Imhotep had a secret health elixir hidden deep inside the great pyramid. With my guide Hassan and an ancient map we have begun our quest to discover this elixir.Upon entry to the great pyramid we encountered our first booby trap! The passageway behind us slammed shut and the floor in front of us started to retract inwards towards us creating an ever growing gap to the slowly closing door at the other end. Hassan and I began to sprint to the other end of the passageway only to discover that the gap was too far to jump and the door was closing to quickly on the other end. In a panic Hassan and I took our rope and hook and threw it underneath the door as it closed and we fell off the receding floor. SLAM! We swung into the opposing wall on the other side underneath the closed door, helpless. As we hung suspended by our ropes, me, not being the strongest struggled to hang on and dropped my torch in the process. I watched it fall as it illuminated the bottomless pit below us. Then I saw it, an out of place shadow. Hassan and I lowered ourselves down quickly to find a secret ledge leading to a passage way 40 feet below us. Hassan and I swung down onto the ledge. PHEW! A close one, any longer and my arms for sure would have given up on me.Now going down the passageway we discovered a mossy field, roughly 50 yards by 50 yards. Skeptical I took a bone from a nearby dead skeleton and tossed it into the mossy field. SIZZLE! The bone fell right through the moss into a pool of acid below. Scary! Some sort of mossy algae must have grown over the acid to disguise such a deadly trap. Using the bones of the skeleton Hassan and I poked at the secret acid pool to discover stepping stones scattered every few feet. Poking and hopping on the stones we made it to the other side. In this time. We heard pick axes echoing through the chambers.My rival Klaus had arrived it seemed, the pressure was on. Klaus works for the Germans. There’s no way I was going to let him get to the elixir before me and on top of that, he had modern tools to help him, along with German soldiers at his disposal. That’s makes him a cheater, he doesn’t deserve to win.Following our map we found the next chamber, this trap was a classic, pressure sensitive pads on the floor that triggered deadly arrows. Easy. The next obstacle stumped us. It was a water fall. While a sight to see we didn’t know what to do. We could hear Klaus and his men getting closer. With no ideas left, Hassan and I jumped down the water fall. Lucky for us there was a deep pool at the bottom. Hassan and I gasped for air as Klaus and his men ran in at the top of the waterfall. Klaus unleased a fury storm of bullets on us. Hassan and I took a deep breath and went under the water. Bullets whizzed into the water as we looked for a desperate escape, lungs burning and yearning for oxygen we found it, an underwater tunnel leading to the next chamber. With moments left before blacking out Hassan pulled me out of the water into the dry tunnel. I gasped for air. I had never held my breath for that long before. We started to head down the tunnel to find that it split into 4 separate passageways.I reached for our map only to find that the water had rubbed off all the markings on it. RATS! What to do. Hassan and I started to talk things through. During this however my mom called me to dinner, so I had to hid pause on the game for now. I can’t wait to get back to playing though.These games seem to be as fun as your imagination is! I highly recommend getting this book to play the games. They are so realistic!For those wondering how the book is set up. Adventure is set up in the following. They give a few prompts/points to consider for creating your character. This includes things like age, gender, occupation, backstory. Then it helps you set up a goal that your are going for. Along with your main antagonistic force. There's also a few things mentioned to help you figure out and set up the scenerio/story your bout to begin. Then whatever you have in your head you just go with it and play it all out based on what you defined previously.",5

"2760","Free to Focus: A Total Productivity System to Achieve More by Doing Less","A modern system to getting the RIGHT things done!!","S Prabhu","0801075262","R1899UPO77Y05A","1555386700","I was lucky enough to get early access to an electronic version of Michael Hyatt’s new book, Free to Focus. However, the best testimonial for the book is that I bought a hard copy of the book for my bookshelf.
I read the book around 4 weeks back on a weekend, stopping to complete some of the thinking exercises Michael suggests as one proceeds through the book. Here are my most powerful takeaways from the book-
1. Stop to think about what success means to me, and review tasks I am doing and instead think in terms of ways to complete projects that really take me forward in my journey. Michael rightly says it is not “getting things done”, it is more about “getting the right things done”.
With this paradigm shift in thinking, I have been able to complete a number of daily tasks and habits for the last month since I read the book using the pointers in the book.
2. Thinking of the activities during the week in terms of morning and evening rituals, on stage, off stage and backstage activities. This is a powerful way to think about what one does during the week, and in my case, made me feel less guilty about the times when I was recovering from intense focused work by spending time with the kids, exercising or reading a book, as this off stage activity is important to sustain the on stage activity.
3. Celebrating wins along the way. While this seems common sense, this can be hard to remember to do consistently, both as an individual and as a leader of a team. I have made marks on my calendar where I will pause, congratulate myself and the team for work well done and course correct if things are not going to plan.
4. Saying “no” to something means saying “yes” to something that is more valuable. I have declined good offers over the last month that I would have normally said yes to and I actually good about this!
5. Dividing goals into achievement and habit goals and having the “SMARTER” goal set up in my planner has helped make some activities that were normally a drag into a rather enjoyable habit.

I combined the teachings in this book with two other books I read recently- Atomic Habits by James Clear and Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport and I feel this is a nice trifecta of books that should be on every productive person’s self. And to quote Michael Hyatt, “productive” does not mean getting more things done faster through hacks, rather getting the right things done as steps towards completing big projects that move the needle forward.
Needless to say, I highly recommend this book!!",5

It is an undeniable masterpiece that defines who Stephen King is as a novelist. All of the elements of Stephen King's strengths come through in great form here:1. All the main characters are intricately defined, you get to see and understand why they are the way they are. The movie is excellent but the book presents backgrounds on Jack and Wendy that define them much more effectively than the movie does.2. A well-presented location that is completely entwined in the dark terrors the novel presents.3. A satisfying, epic conclusion.",5

Rachel’s “Girl, Wash Your Face” wrecked me in the best way. Yet, I just wasn’t sure about this one.Well, it’s great. It’s even more practical than GWYF with specific action steps and behaviors to put into practice. It’s straightforward while giving space for each woman to make the wisdom work for them. Once again, Rachel said exactly what I didn’t know I needed to hear.I’d be lying if I said I agreed with everything or with how it is presented. (For example, ambition and hard work only get you so far. I mean, you can’t win American Idol if you literally can’t sing. And while I like her definition of hustle, I can’t get behind the application 100%.) That doesn’t detract from the overall chunks of wisdom. Excuse 5: I Can’t Pursue My Dream and Still Be A Good Mom & Excuse 6: I’m Terrified Of Failure are worth the price of the book alone.

"2891","131 Method: Your Personalized Nutrition Solution to Boost Metabolism, Restore Gut Health, and Lose Weight","Lots of information here","Emily Paine","1401956785","RDUF1RFDBPCF","1555402342","I love reading about healthy diets and the science behind them. This book was quite interesting as it was a new take on ""dieting"" with fasting being involved. There is a lot to take in with this book. You do need to follow a plan and know what you are doing, and I feel at this point that I would need to go back to the beginning and take notes on how to follow her 131 method. The three stages of Ignite, Nourish and Renew are still a bit muddled in my brain, but as I was reading them, they made sense at the time. To be honest though, this isn't a plan I am going to follow, at least not at the moment. I prefer to not eat meat, and there are ways to get around that with this plan. I can see it inspiring people, and some of the recipes in the back of the book sound extremely good. I do have to watch sodium levels, and the amounts of sodium in recipes are not listed but one can estimate which items are high in sodium. She did also write that ""recent science finds that people over the age of 60 who have high LDL cholesterol actually live longer than people with low LDL."" Hmm, news to me as I just read the book by Caldwell Esselstyn (Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease), and he explains quite a bit about atherosclerosis and the importance of lowering cholesterol and LDL by a plant based diet. Plus, as I had some atherosclerosis, I was advised to take a statin to lower cholesterol. It makes it difficult to know what to believe is the best diet/food for oneself. I think this book has some excellent points in it and it will increase your knowledge about nutrition, gut health and metabolism. I will be keeping it on my bookshelf and trying out a few of the recipes for sure.",4

Even from far away Africa I identified with her life and the changing landscape. This is a history of America — a history of the conquest of the west, the destruction of the indigenous people and the land. It’s a record of the impact of colonial settlers on the landscape. It’s a record of how greed impacted on the landscape and on society. It’s a record of famine, corruption, exploitation — how cycles of greed, weather conditions, drought, famine repeat. The cycle of good presidents, bad presidents, downright evil presidents and their policies that wreak havoc. We learn nothing from the past.
Besides being a biography of how the west was won and homesteaded, it is a biography of Laura Ingalls-Wilder. The second half of the book gives itself over to the relationship between Laura her daughter Rose, a challenging relationship). Rose, also a writer, encouraged her mother to write her story late in her life. She said Laura should stop saving money but rather make money. Very different from Laura, Rose was an opportunist, teetering on the edge of honesty. She liberally edited her mother’s work, stole her ideas, competed as a writer.

"2911","Daisy Jones & The Six: A Novel","4 Stars","Kindle Customer","1524798622","R3E5KIYWLWPNFF","1555403980","This <b>4 Star</b> novel, written in the style of a documentary from interviews of eyewitnesses and participants, is one of the most imaginative and unique books I have read in a long time. author, Taylor Jenkins Reid made a bold and interesting story telling style choice and it paid off!<b>SUMMARY</b>This book is written as a biography of a fictitious band named <i>Daisy Jones & The. Six</i>. It is written in documentary format and doesn't read like a fiction nor could I find anything in my kindle version that spelled out the fact that it was all fiction; therefore, I couldn't decide in the beginning if any of it was real. I ended up googling Daisy Jones and the various members of The Six just to be sure. It was that convincing.This book reminds me of the movie  ""<i>Almost Famous</i>."" It follows a band in the 1970's on its way to both fame and self destruction. It covers the relationships of its members; their struggles and triumphs focusing mainly on Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne. It captures the time; the whole groupie scene, ""<i>the sex drugs and rock & roll</i>"" era. The story culminates in the band falling apart at the height of their fame, everything leading up to the implosion causing the split. The slow accumulation of jealousy, both petty annoyances and major betrayals.<b>WHAT I LOVED</b>This is a very character driven story. While there is a lot of action, most of the action is based on the character's thoughts, feelings and reactions to situations. In order to make that work, the characters must be interesting and well developed, and each of the characters were.The format works very well for this story. I truly appreciate the way Reid wove the story together, it took a lot of creativity and imagination to create this book.I loved hearing the story from so many points of view; it was interesting to see how people often saw the same situation so differently.<b>WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE</b>I loved almost everything about this book, but there were a couple places where it dragged, mostly during the parts where they were working on lyrics.<b>OVERALL</b>What a great, highly entertaining book. It's not for kids though, there was a lot of sex and drugs.",4

I've read every one and plan one day to go back and start from #1 again. What a great series; she sure has come a long way. This wasn't my favorite in the series, but I still enjoyed it a lot. The characters are what make this series, in my opinion. Some of the stories are great and others a little less so. This particular book was kind of convoluted and slow to get under way. At times it seemed to be all over the place.

I like the time spent at Chelstone with the extended family, and the fact that James' parents see Maisie as a daughter. I adore Anna and think she adds so much to the mix; watching her grow up will add a nice touch to the whole series (as will Mark Scott! ;-).

One thing that I wondered about was the title. Catherine was not any kind of an 'American Agent' that I could see, unless I missed something important. So I don't understand the title. I guess it could refer to Scott, but the titles usually relate to the main storyline/murder. In any event, now we have to wait another year to see these characters again.

MULLIGAN","006243666X","R3L74091LOA39B","1555413402","The title is something of a misnomer -- perhaps a bit of a tease for where Maisie's life is headed next, since ""the American agent"" plays only a peripheral role in this episode. That aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, which I finished all in a rush late last night. Maisie's adult life has now encompassed two world wars, a personal rise from household downstairs maid to trusted investigator and advisor in the mold of her mentor, who is no longer with us in this world but always present to her in spirit and counsel. (I often take his advice myself!) It has been a pleasure to watch both Maisie's brilliant career and her personal relationships with family, friends, men, and children unfold as she matures and absorbs wisdom from every source she encounters. Her lifelong friendship with Priscilla is a delight --two such different women with such different lives appreciating and advising and deeply loving one another. Rarely is female friendship portrayed with such affectionate insight.

Of particular interest at this point in Maisie's life is the setting in early WW2 London, with the blliz forcing daily races to shelter, the city burning around its citizens, and the legendary resolute response of the British people on full display. At this point in time, the United States is controlled by an isolationist faction, the Allied Alliance still lies in the future, and the efforts of Roosevelt and other leaders in the U.S. and Britain to inform and persuade the American people of the necessity of their entrance into the war play a major part in the novel and its central mystery. Jacqueline Winspear does not wave flags beyond the natural sympathy her characters generate but, in light of today's political situation in both the US and the UK, the background related here is important for all of us to understand.

Settle in for a great read -- another Maisie that's almost impossible to put down!",5

Well, I've finished the book but haven't started the diet. (Passover is coming up...soon). But I do have to say that Dr Ian Smith's newest book, ""Clean and Lean"" is well written and very informative. Most of these ""diet books"" seem to be pamphlet-size information with ""padding"" to make it book-length. Thus worth buying.

Ian Smith's book gives a 30 day program using ""clean"" foods, along with a program he calls ""Intermittent fasting"", which he writes about in great detail. He also gives a full 30 day-by-day menu, with fasting days indicated. Maybe some of it is padding but I think the reader will gain a lot of information about good ways to diet and clean yourself.

"3002","Two Weeks: A Novel (The Baxter Family)","A compelling story","Ann","147670743X","R2SJNZK503MWHV","1555414951","This story is wonderful.

Of all the many books that Karen Kingsbury has written, I think this is her most important one and has the most potential to influence lives. She tackles the difficult issue of teen pregnancy and the impact on family and friends. But more importantly, Karen Kingsbury has given a clarion call for choosing to save the baby’s life by rejecting abortion.

There is such compassion in this story for Elise, the young teenage mother who must difficult decisions about her baby. The author leads us through her decision making process as Elise considers abortion, adoption, or keeping the baby. Her emotions are treated with respect, but clearly show her inner turmoil of weighing the best options for herself as compared to the best options for the baby’s future.

As Elise makes her final decision to put the baby up for adoption, she has a two week option to change her mind once the baby is born. Her chosen adoptive parents, Aaron and Lucy, have not only experienced the loss of their own child, but also the loss of an adoptive child during a waiting period time.
Their story is a heart-tugging one, and we experience their difficult decisions, too. Daring to put their hearts on the line once more to have the chance to adopt a baby is a difficult decision that they must make.

There’s also a call for foster parenting in the storyline of Theo and Alma.
They experience great tragedy and foster parenting would seem to be the last thing they’d consider.
All of these storylines meet together and become a story that will keep you reading to the conclusion.

A note to the faithful readers of the Baxter Family series: DO NOT miss this book as it focuses on Landon, Ashley, and Cole. Their family comes together to help Elise, and Cole’s story is a major part of this book.

"3041","Someone Knows","Fascinating","J.K","0525539646","R119ROZ3X62G3C","1555418327","Lisa Scottolini’s standalone novel, Someone Knows is an intense novel that will grip readers immediately. Allie Garvey shares an ugly secret with a few others, and twenty years has passed since she and a group of her friends got drunk, handled a gun, and witnessed the death of an acquaintance when he shot himself playing Russian roulette. None of the group knows who loaded the gun, and none have mentioned the secret in the twenty years since it happened. At the time, they had all agreed to keep their involvement in the death a secret, and the police ruled the death a suicide without knowledge that the group witnessed the shooting; none of them were prosecuted. Allie has come back to her hometown to attend the funeral of one of the members of the group, and hopes that the guilt she has felt for twenty years will go away. Allie has punished herself throughout the years, and her guilt has affected every aspect of her life. Attending the funeral and expecting closure, Allie finds that things get worse, and as she tries to untangle the mysteries surrounding the incident, she finds herself in grave danger.

Scottolini is excellent at developing her characters, and she makes them appear believable; readers will put themselves in the position of the characters and relate to their plights. It seems that everyone knows someone in their lives who is similar to those in the novel, so it seems real. The novel is well-organized, and Scottolini’s writing style makes the book difficult to put down. The novel is very intense, and some of the issues are uncomfortable.

Someone Knows is an excellent novel for those who enjoy thrillers with intense plots and intense scenarios. The subject matter in this novel can be a bit unnerving, which will keep most readers on the edge of their seats. Close to the end, readers will think they have figured things out, but there is a twist at the end that will be totally unexpected.

Our series hero Cotton Malone returns, along with Stephanie Nelle and Cotton's heir apparent Luke, in another race-against-the-clock risky exploit full of evil villains and world-shaking secrets.While I enjoyed the story, I must confess I am growing weary of the ""world-shaking secrets"" so often coming back to the Vatican and Christianity. One of the reasons I keep reading Berry's work is that he really digs around to find or create ""secrets"" that range from roots in ancient civilizations to modern democracy. We all know the Catholic Church has screwed up the world in many ways and the premise here is slightly fresh but still tinged with the whole ""Popes Are Bad"" trope. That made this reading experience a little bland for me, only because I've read so much in the genre.Even so, I do always enjoy Steve Berry's work and this one will appeal to fans of the Cotton Malone series for sure.

GWYF is a motivating read that had me wanting to prioritize and change my life. It was a book that showed us all the lies believe about ourselves. Girl, Stop Apologizing is a bit different as it goes through different excuses people make to not go after the goals they have for themselves.If you are at a point in your life that you’re striving for something, this is a book you could use. There were many quotes I wrote down to go over later because they inspired me. This is a book that doesn’t jus tell you to go after your goals, but it gives you tips and advice to go after them. Rachel’s personality shines through her writing and I for one, love that!

Dr. Nevaeh Patel, a former astronaut is convinced she was saved by aliens while on a space walk and now she must release an EMP that was launched on a satellite and that along with the Holy Grail that was recently discovered can save her and give her immortality (seriously).

So, I jumped at the chance to read his latest book, Lessons from Lucy, combining as it did his trademark wit and stories about a dog.

Like Dave, I am the parent of an older large dog. I’m reading this book, at the point where Dave writes that “when we say her name or reach down to pet her, her tail thumps the floor in a drumbeat of joy”, at the same time that I’m petting Cooper, whose tail is thumping the floor in the same drumbeat.

There’s no new ground covered here. You could write out all the lessons without reading the book. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a fun book or that I didn’t laugh. I did. Sometimes out loud. So many of his stories hit home for me. “Whenever you see the word “motivational” used in a corporate training context, you should just substitute the word “stupid”.” Yup. Or when he recounts his fun with Comcast because I swear I’ve had the exact same conversation with those idiots.

It’s an extremely easy read and is perfect when you need an escape from the heavy dramas or psychological thrillers. And it reminds us of the most important lesson of all, that time is fleeting and we should enjoy it with our two and four legged loved ones.

My thanks to netgalley and Simon & Schuster for an advance copy of this book.",5

"3138","Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed","""Often what seem like trivial worries are manifestations of deeper ones.""","spanakopita NJ","1328662055","R3SMERJKD07P6I","1555426301","Lori Gottlieb is a Los Angeles-based psychotherapist who reveals her vulnerability in ""Maybe You Should Talk to Someone."" In her office, she is a skilled and empathetic listener who tries to support her clients while they work through their problems. Ironically, as the book opens, Lori's significant other, whom she calls Boyfriend, leaves her after they have been together for two years. He claims that he wants his freedom and has no interest in co-parenting Lori's eight-year-old son, Zach. Gottlieb feels betrayed, infuriated, and becomes so depressed that she frequently bursts into tears. Since she is having difficulty letting go of her fury and despair, she decides to visit a therapist herself.

In this rich, meaningful, and entertaining work of non-fiction, the author explains how talk therapy can be beneficial. Naysayers claim that it is impractical and expensive to visit a mental health practitioner for months or even years. Gottlieb asserts, however, that an individual who is fortunate enough to find the right therapist may acquire useful coping skills, achieve a measure of self-awareness, and find a path to joy and fulfillment. Gottlieb once said in an interview that ""we’re so afraid of the truth that sometimes we even hide it from ourselves."" One of a therapist's tasks is to help remove the blinkers from our eyes.

On one level, ""Maybe You Should Talk to Someone"" is an introduction to the art of psychotherapy. Gottlieb writes lucidly about therapeutic terminology, touches on the contributions of pioneers in the field, and provides insight into what can be accomplished if someone's treatment progresses well. The author has a marvelous sense of humor (much of it self-deprecating), and the case studies that she presents are intriguing. It is fascinating to observe Lori in session with John, a narcissistic, sarcastic, and obnoxious writer for a popular television series who believes that he is smarter and more competent than everyone else. Julie is a young woman who discovers shortly after her wedding that she may not have long to live. Rita, a gifted artist, has repeatedly failed at marriage and is estranged from her adult children. While Lori does her best to help her patients heal themselves, she also continues to visit her own therapist, whose guidance enables her to recognize why she has been obsessing so much about her ex-boyfriend. This is a candid, engrossing, and poignant book in which Lori Gottlieb suggests that psychotherapy can help us uncover the hidden truths about ourselves and pave the way for constructive change.",5

(And one of Rose is particularly disturbing.) I usually am excited to recommend new books, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. In fact, as much as I love books, I am not going to keep this one because I will never want to reread it. Ironically, another book I didn't keep was one of the ""sequels"" written by a modern author.

It's a beautiful way to end the day with your babies.

She is ambivalent about pursuing therapy, a reluctant participant and a decidedly non-compliant patient mixing copious amounts of liquor with random dosages of pharmaceuticals.  She indulges heavily in Hitchcock movies and watches her neighborhood through her windows.  Whether she sees something threatening or not, she is a dubious witness;  easily dissuaded from her point of view by her own panic attacks.  As a reader, it is a twisty tale, difficult to unwind and intensely interesting.

"3217","The Last Stone: A Masterpiece of Criminal Interrogation","Cold case solved","Jean Cole","0802147305","R2HFLM4M8OY4UM","1555431484","This extraordinary book about the long cold case of the kidnapping of the Lyons sisters decades ago in the Maryland suburbs of DC brought back memories I thought I’d long forgotten.

I lived in DC when the daughters of John Lyons, a local radio personality, and his wife, disappeared from the Wheaton Mall, apparently kidnapped, never to be heard from or seen again. While local police thought they had arrested the right suspect, there was never sufficient evidence to convict him, but he spent 30
years in jail nonetheless.

The book begins as he’s about to be released. An almost retired detective with eyes and ears for cold cases remembers the case when the release date draws near, and, not one for passing up an attempt to bring true justice to horrible people, starts talking to the guy (whose name escapes me right now) and in a masterpiece of detective work that no novelist, no matter how good, strings the kidnapper/killer along until there’s enough solid evidence to keep him in prison for the rest of his life.

While the family could never possibly recover from this tragedy, at least they are finally able to lay their daughters to rest in eternal peace.

Despite the horrendous circumstances that this book describes, it is a masterpiece of outstanding writing. I could barely put it down. It’s certainly not for the faint of heart. It’s just unimaginable that such horrible acts occur. And it’s remarkable when cases this cold are solved. My heart went out to the Lyons when this happened and it goes out to them again.

I received this book as an ARC from the publisher and NetGalley and give it my highest recommendation.",5

"3246","When We Left Cuba","So happy to have Beatriz's story!","Rachel M","045149086X","RQBO5P7NAGMVT","1555433535","As I was reading Next Year in Havana last year, I was so intrigued by the fiery and outspoken sister, Beatriz, and hoped that we would get to hear her story. Well, I got my wish and When We Left Cuba is all about Beatriz and what happened after her family was exiled from Cuba to southern Florida by the Castro regime in the 1960s. This striking story about a woman who makes it her mission to avenge her brother’s death and bring down the man responsible is riveting from beginning to end.

Beatriz’s tale is full of espionage, covert operations, and dangerous missions—but aside from her desire for revenge, she’s a woman who falls in love with a man who will never be able to leave his own sense of duty and obligation for her, she’s a woman who fights for her place in a society that looks down on her for being an outsider, and she’s a daughter who will never be a placid and demure wallflower looking to be taken care of by a husband. Beatriz is formidable and fierce and she doesn’t need a man to rescue her, thankyouverymuch.

Cleeton does such an amazing job of bringing both the United States and Cuba of the 1960s to life. The descriptions and imagery are vivid, the storytelling is sharp, and the characters pop off the page. There were a couple of places where the pacing felt heavy, but this is the kind of story that you can feel how much love and history has been poured into each chapter. If you love historical fiction with a side of glamour, romance, and intrigue, When We Left Cuba will be right up your alley and I highly recommend it.",5

"3258","The Third Pillar: How Markets and the State Leave the Community Behind","Inclusive Localism","David Shulman","525558314","R1XE3YT1K4PGS9","1555434524","Raghuram Rajan, a University of Chicago finance professor, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, former Chief Economist at the IMF and the one who blew the whistle on the dangers embedded in the derivatives markets at a 2005 Federal Reserve conference has written an important book on the political crisis of our time. Unfortunately it is too long and too dry. That said he is spot on in noting how the state and the market has taken over the historical role of community in our society. No wonder folks are alienated.He focuses in on the communities that have been left out of the global economy over the past fifty years from rural towns, isolated factory communities and the inner city. All of this being exacerbated by a flood of immigrants who put downward pressure on low end wages and upward pressure on rents and the geographic sorting of the global elites in very expensive neighborhoods and metropolitan areas making upward mobility difficult. Because the major urban centers have become so expensive Rajan focuses on place-based strategies as opposed to people-based strategies to uplift the left behind. He focuses on what he calls “inclusive localism.” By that he means that wealthy communities have to affirmatively loosen up their planning controls and society as a whole has to invest in infrastructure in poorer communities.However this is all too easy to say and very difficult to implement. Wealthy communities are not opening their doors and for poorer communities to uplift themselves there has to be a requisite amount of indigenous leadership ready and willing to take charge.My own view is that inclusive localism would be far easier to implement if we returned to the 100 year old ideology of the melting pot. I know this is not politically correct, but it largely worked for white America and probably can work for all of America today. If we are to have inclusive communities there is going to have to a lot give from all corners. It sort of comes down to that old saying of “think globally and act locally.” Further it would help if we had a program of national service where young people of different backgrounds are forced to work together on common goals and it would also help if the elite universities radically increased their class size to accommodate more students.Rajan closes the book with his global solution to today’s economic problems. To me that is a bridge too far and ought to be the subject of a different book.",4
"3260","Mama's Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What…","What animals feel","Angie Boyter","0393635066","R32ODFQ12WIZVO","1555434697","We humans like to think we are something special, that we have qualities no other animal possesses. Many people believe that our emotions are among the things that make us human. Primatologist Frans De Waal used to go along with this prevailing belief, but he has spent many years studying our closest relatives, and he says “More and more I believe that all the emotions we are familiar with can be found one way or another in all mammals, and that the variation is only in the details, elaborations, applications, and intensity.” In Mama’s Last Hug he makes his case for this position, and the result is both fascinating and convincing.De Waal says that modern emotion research puts too much stress on language, and that is part of the problem.  We humans don’t use language to recognize and respond to emotions of other humans in our daily lives; we observe; and DeWaal uses observation as his scientific tool to argue engagingly, but also convincingly, in favor of a rich emotional life for animals other than humans.He won me over  in Chapter 1  with a description of a moving reunion between Mama, a 59-year-old chimpanzee who was on her deathbed, and 80-year-old Jan van Hooff, who had been De Waal’s dissertation advisor and who had worked with Mama for many years. If you are skeptical of De Waal’s description, the reunion video is available on YouTube, and to me there is no doubt about Mama’s genuine joy at seeing her old friend.If DeWaal’s wonderful anecdotes do not convince you, consider his credentials. How often do you read a book by an IgNobel Prize winner? For those of you not familiar with the Ig Nobel prizes, they have been awarded annually since 1991 (on the Harvard campus but not by Harvard) to ""honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think.""  The paper that won the Ig Nobel for De Waal was called “Faces and Behinds”, and it was a study in which his team learned that apes have a “whole-body” image of familiar individuals and could even pick out individuals they knew from pictures of that ape’s derriere. My first reaction, of course, was to laugh, but then I had to recognize that this was clever work that tells me something rather impressive about apes.I had more laughs, some more sad moments, and a lot of thoughtful moments throughout the book.  Do read it; I am confident that you will come away with a greater feeling of kinship with all the creatures, great and small.",5

"3267","A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood: The Poetry…","Welcome to the neighborhood -- in book form","Sal Nudo","168369113X","R1I4NWFRJRMLD8","1555435026","I knew right away when I saw the cover of this hardcover book that it would be special. The cover illustration is brilliantly colorful and shows a gleeful Mr. Fred Rogers in all his glory with his famous puppet friends.Open the book and you'll find in the table of contents a listing of an astounding 75 songs in the form of poems. Several are singalong classics many of us know from Mr. Rogers' popular PBS show, but most were new to me.The majority of these poems get to the heart of who children are and what they feel, and they also gently teach. The simple advice resonates in the lyrics of poems such as ""Be the Best of Whatever You Are"" and ""I Like You as You Are."" The poem/song ""Children Can"" nails to a tee what it's like to be small. Other poems such as ""It's Good to Talk"" are encouraging and encourage introspection.There is lots of positivity and encouragement here. It makes you wonder why adults need therapy, drugs, or loads of self-help books to get by in life when they could simply listen to the words of Mr. Rogers. ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" takes me back to a more innocent time and makes me wish people in society were more like Fred Rogers.Simple. Fun. Honest. Beautiful. Bright. Those are some of the ways I would describe this book. ""You Are You"" shows that we are universal in the sense that we're all different. Occasionally there are poems that don't teach but are cheerful, fun, or goofy, ones such as ""Elephants,"" ""Summer Rain,"" ""It's an Ugly Day,"" and ""Walking Giraffe."" But mostly, these are poems that show children they are special and that they can dream and do.The writings are simple, often repetitive, and subtle in their teachings. It was fun to come across the several works that Rogers collaborated on with Josie Carey, who contributed as the lyricist, with Rogers handling the music. Her words were often a bit more complex and plentiful than Rogers', though not always. Their songs/poems together include ""Find a Star,"" ""Then Your Heart is Full of Love,"" ""Creation Duet,"" and ""I'm Tame.""It's not all rainbows, friendships, and balloons, however, as Rogers knew that kids go through tough things; some of his songs reflected that. He has a tender way of saying to them ""You can get through it."" I can envision children pondering the meaning of some of these words and looking inside themselves to search their feelings. A sense of realism often comes through in the lyrics, as shown in the poem ""Good People Sometimes do Bad Things.""And in some of these poems, I think Rogers is conveying what he's been through personally and how he feels and gets through difficult moments in life.I haven't said nearly enough about the brilliant drawings by Luke Flowers, whose illustrations are lively, colorful, and detailed. His images complement the work wonderfully and offer a modern bent to Rogers' timeless music.""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" ends as if rock stars are doing an encore: The last three songs/poems are ""I'm Proud of You,"" ""Tomorrow,"" and, what else, ""It's Such a Good Feeling.""If I had a newborn child, I'd buy him or her this book in a heartbeat. But you know what? As an oft-confused adult who sometimes gets it wrong, this book is still invaluable and inspirational.",5

"3280","Mama's Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What…","READ IT!","David Keymer","0393635066","R3137N4ZK1C5R4","1555435537","From his 1982 Chimpanzee Politics on, animal ethologist de Waal has explored and commented on the parallels  in human and animal (primarily simian) behavior.  This book is only the latest –the twelfth- in a long going dialogue, the last of which was 2016’s Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? This book  is thus about similarities between humans and animals, and the similarities are apparent and profuse. As De Waal notes repeatedly in this book,  why should we be surprised that Nature repeats itself? It is simpler to build modifications on a common platform and in most respects, there is little difference structurally or functionally between ape and human. But the book is also about emotions and the role they play in intelligence. If you have read the work of neuroscientist Antonio Damasio (whom De Waal cites), it won’t come as a surprise that emotions play a vital role in our decision making process. Block emotions and you can no longer decide anything. Emotions and intellect are a package in humans, not separated entities. And De Waal makes it clear that animals, not just humans, feel these motions. A good part of this book is an attack on the science-based bias that body is inferior to mind, and then, that animals are somehow distinct from humans in our essential functions--  they  don’t feel the emotions we do and thus we cannot apply to them labels like affection, grief, shame, guilt and envy.(De Waal has interesting comments on the significance of deny in social animals.) For De Waal, it is fairly simple: humans, simians, all the way down through colony fish, benefit more in the long run from cooperation than from out and our war, and thus we all have developed –evolved- ways to moderate our behavior in groups, and emotions are a key part of this: they give us advance but flexible signals (unlike rigid Skinnerian responses) to guide our choices in potentially fraught situations.As always, De Waal draws on hard and observational science both, and draws  acute and sensible from what he observes.",5

Even many of those I know who watched him were unaware that he had written the lyrics to songs performed on his show. This book has 75 of these poem/songs and it is one delightful book.Geared to children, it holds wisdom that many adults could benefit from. It's the kind of book that a child's parent, relative, godparent, grandparent, babysitter or nanny would enjoy, and learn from, while reading to a child.Within these various songs/poems, there is a great deal of ""guidance"" and inspiration about interacting with the world around us and learning how to BE and accept, and celebrate, one's self. These works are proof that you can, even from the youngest ages, create a positive environment of learning for a child. Feelings and emotions are dealt with in a way that, honestly, are as helpful to adults as any child. So many challenges we all face are dealt with in a straightforward way that belies the great heart and emotional intelligence behind the word.There is an honesty and a simplicity to the verses but also great depth--the sign of timeless literature, no matter its form.This is a book that should be read in daycare centers, in kindergarten, in any place where children are gathered.Reading this, as an adult, I find myself feeling uplifted and comforted. I can only imagine what a difference this could make in a child's life if it were read to them, if they were exposed to its kindness, compassion, acceptance for ourselves and others, as they grew up. It makes me wish I had had someone to read them to me. Luckily, as an adult, I can read them  myself.Among my favorites (that could be directed just as easily at adults) are:>Many Ways to Say I Love You>Sometimes Isn't Always>You've Got to Do It>The Truth Will Make Me FreeThis book is a joy and a delight. It's on my gift list for the families I know with young children.Illustrations are geared to children and delightfully straightforward (I'm not looking for artistic flights of fancy in a book that is written with younger children in mind.)",5

Obviously the poetry and songs are very simple, just the way they worked on his show, and for singing to kids.  I really enjoyed this as I said, and I can't wait to share it with my 7 year old niece and one year old nephew.

In an effort to maximize this potential, we picked up this book of songs in hopes of getting him to embrace the values these songs address.  Have you ever listened to the words of these songs, I mean, really listened?  Every one is written by Fred Rogers and they are beautiful, simple, and perfectly reflect values that so many of us want to convey to our children, but yet are so hard to find outside the home.  We love this book, and our child loves it too.  We have struggled with some of the songs and not knowing them, but online video sources have provided some assistance there in showing us how to sing them.  You can fudge your way through it, but how wonderful would it be if there was an accompanying CD.  It's still a great book, and there are enough songs here that you will never run out when it comes to singing at bedtime.  The one song my child loves the most by Mr Rogers is not listed, which is Goodnight God, and you can find that online with one search, and like most of his songs, it's easy to memorize.  We can't say enough good things about this book.  We miss you, Mr Rogers.  Thank you for all that you did for not only us, but also for our children.If you have any questions, just ask in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them.",5

Watching Neighborhood as an adult with my own children, I found I was constantly looking up the words to songs so I could sing them to my children at bedtime and this puts it all the best stuff in one place.  The illustrations are great for reading with children and combine the feel of the old show with a more modern art style.  I would have loved some photos in the mix from the actual set and an additional index that indicated which songs/rhymes/poems were from specific episodes of Neighborhood so that I could try and track down some of the more unexpected ones, and so that I could tell which ones were from a Neighborhood episode vs. which ones were just from his poetry.  BUT even without any of that, it's still a great collection to have.  It doesn't have every song from the show (my husband is a birder, so around our house we get a lot of kicks from singing the Mimus Polyglottos is My Pet and Troglodytes Aedon songs, but neither are in this collection) but it is a selection of some of the songs that address feelings, love, family and most of the songs that you'd hear somewhat regularly on the show.

And all of them are wholesome, honest, and carefully worded in that special Mr Rogers way. They meet the child at their level, without talking down to them. Far from, the subject matter is sometimes pretty heavy, but never in a way that would depress or frighten a child.The illustrations are gorgeous, slightly cartoonish versions of Mr Rogers, his house, and the land of make believe, with it's cast of puppets. The overall design of this book is great. Just enough illustration to set the tone, and to keep pre-readers engaged as you read to them, without shifting focus away from the inspired and meaningful lyrics.There's a special nod to Mr. Rogers fans with page 143.Oh, and while these are all songs, they all work perfectly fine spoken, if you don't know the melody, or prefer not to sing!Solid recommend.",5

I laughed, I cried and laughed again. Incredibly informative , I ended up using an entire highlighter on this book (hence the highlighter color changes in video). It’s an absolutely fascinating view on human and animal emotions and the big question “do animals have feelings?”. My first thought whenever I hear someone ask that is: ‘they’ve never had a pet before’, as I think most of us dog (and/or cat) people have a hard time believing that anyone could believe animals don’t have feelings. But this delves deep into the difference between emotions and feelings and our tendency as humans to anthropomorphize. When your dog gives you a “guilty” look after peeing on the carpet is he feeling guilt or is he just sucking up because he knows you’re angry?  Why are humans the only animals to blush? Why do humans have a white sclera around their eyes when most mammals have little to no white in theirs? These are just a fraction of the fascinating questions that will be discussed in this awesome book on a subject we could all stand to learn more about. Who knows, maybe if we all read more books like this we would have more respect for other species (and perhaps even our own)!",5

All opinions are 100% my own and independent of receiving an advance copy.No matter what neighbourhood you live in, you are bound to have heard of Mr. Rogers. Fred Rogers was an incredible man, musician, puppeteer, writer, composer and children’s educator that was most famous for his television show Mister Rogers’ Neighbourhood. He revolutionized the way children’s shows reached children. He didn’t believe in turning into a different character but being realistic and speaking to children as your authentic self. He tackled many difficult subjects like racism, divorce and children with disabilities. He wrote hundreds of songs and created a whole land of make believe.This book takes the lyrics to many of his most recognizable songs and turns them into poems, with illustrations by Luke Flowers, reminding us of Mr. Rogers’ ability to find the beauty in the most simple things. At the back there is an index of subjects that the songs/poems deal with like manners, friendship, and positivity. Some of them are so familiar I could hear the tune as I read them. Others just take you back to feeling you had when you watched him. He was a friend, a confidant, someone who knew all sides of you, the silly side, the angry, sad, and happy side. This book will introduce him to a whole new audience. It’s a timeless keepsake that you could read to your children and your grandchildren.",5

Descriptions of Rose made me question just how often a person can be described as ""even more depressed.""

Ironically, the author focused a lot on the editorial relationship that Rose provided her mother yet seems to have written this book with little input from an editor. I question the editorial decision to use Wilder and Lane in place of Laura and Rose while needing to use first names for so many other characters.

Overall, this book provides a decent a mount of fact, a ton of political opinion (some of which actually belongs), and way too much explanation of Rose Wilder Lane's crazy life.",4

It has compelling characters and a highly original setting that has strong metaphorical resonance as a monument to the dark history of America.  I feel like it's just a few clunky scenes away from the canon.  King spins off believable characters by the dozen, at least male ones.  Jack Torrance and Danny are memorable.  You can hate Jack and sympathize with him.  He is vain and given to rage, but has love for his family and interest in creating something significant.  There's real originality in how unlikable King allows Jack to be, because we're with him a long time.  Danny is very hard not to root for, but he isn't absolutely perfect.  If you can write children believably, it's always a win, and it is here.  It's not Sound and the Fury or Mary Cassatt, but still, the Compsons weren't psychic either.The Shining though, has a very nice touch that leverages the unique strengths of a book as a medium.  The power of the the child's ESP is to find words that are hiding in other people's minds.  It highlights how powerful words are as concepts and as mantras.  To a child who cannot read the words and does not yet know the concepts, they remain objects of interest and fear.  He can see how they are affecting the adults, but not exactly what they are.  He can see that they are real and potentially dangerous, but the nature of the danger is unknown.  That is masterful, terrifying, and as a literary gambit, it's top notch.  The only parallel I can think of is Nabokov in the last paragraph of the Vane Sisters or in Scrabble game in Ada.  However with the Nabokov, you get the feeling that creating a situation to play the word game was the reason for writing the work.  In the Shining, the word game moves the story forward and the builds understanding of the characters.The great scenes are well worth the time you spend in this.  The missteps and occasional cliche are of the time, and pretty forgivable if you're not complete snob.  I think this book will last, if it can't be considered to have done so already.  The Shining rises far above genre.  It frankly created one.",5

Cowen","0393635066","R3LCHZED44Y7UG","1555441777","A fascinating look at animal homologies for emotions like amusement, anger, disgust, love, sadness, and shame. Other animals laugh both when tickled and when engaged in more abstract play. They console victims. They play pranks. They grieve for the dead. What de Waal teaches us about animals gives us deep insight into our own emotions and those of our closest humans companions. Some have argued that emotions are psychologically constructed, suggesting that we can transcend our emotions merely by unlearning them. Not so. So many of the expressive behaviors that shape our daily social interactions, along with mass messaging, lie deep within our evolutionary roots. Acknowledging, rather than denying, the patterns of behavior that we share with our closest animal relatives is essential to structuring a society conducive to the better angels of our nature. Weaving together beautiful anecdotes with rigorous laboratory evidence, de Waal demonstrates that so much of what we think makes us special -- the good and the bad -- isn't really special to humans at all.",5

I didn’t care much for the movie bit, though.  If this was the way the protagonist related to the world, it got way too much attention.  The guy that lived as her tenant was an odd part of the novel.  His part never really went anywhere and their one-night stand didn’t seem to relate to anything.  A woman as sick as this character would most likely not want sex with a suspicious ex-prisoner.  Actually, I thought the protagonist sounded more male than female throughout the book.  In that event, even though very sick, he/she would want the sex!  The ending was not very good.  It was too contrived and there was way too much explanation from the murderer. It is not good to have to have all this explanation unless you are Agatha Christie.  I prefer light bulb type endings that really surprise you and you can understand for yourself.  Very few writers seem to be able to pull this off, nowadays.  The ending was not shocking or even a very good twist.  After all, it was raining and that was the only time something really happened in the book.  I vacillated between 3 and 4 stars because it did hold my interest although the writing was not great.

"3444","Save Me the Plums: My Gourmet Memoir","Marvelous addition to the food memoir canon","J. M. O'Connor","1400069998","R1IIB5FXU1HJ3C","1555447841","Ruth Reichl’s books are among my favorite food memoirs. I regularly give away copies of Tender At The Bone but Comfort Me With Apples and Garlic And Sapphires are right up there too. After finishing Garlic And Sapphires, which goes into her experiences as the New York Times food critic, I fervently hoped her next book would be about her time as the editor in chief at the now shuttered Gourmet magazine.

Save Me The Plums was worth the weight. Reichl gives a no-holds-barred account of her transition from food critic to EIC, her coworkers, the triumphs, and how it all came to an end. She was a very unconventional choice for EIC and we get to see very clearly how it played out. It made me a little bummed I never read Gourmet, at least not that I can recall. But given her account of what the magazine was like before she took over, I can understand why I would have written it off as “not for me” and never taken another look.

Reichl changed the culture of the staff and that in turn led to vibrant years together. I really enjoyed hearing about the risks they took, the way various people left their imprint on it, and the various writers they hired for articles, including David Foster Wallace. The behind-the-scenes on his piece Consider The Lobster was especially fascinating. She also admits where she messed up and what about the role worked for her and didn’t.

She also shares luminously about 9/11, both the personal impact and how the magazine staff came together to feed the rescue workers. It made me tear up, thinking back to where I was that fateful day and how we’ve changed as a nation since then.

Several recipes are included and I’ve bookmarked a few, including Spicy Chinese Noodles and Thanksgiving Turkey Chili. The love of food permeates the pages and while Reichl has a more adventurous palate than I do, she excels at making her readers love the journey as much as she did. Save Me The Plums is a marvelous addition to the food memoir canon.

I have never read a horror/ghost novel because frankly I get scared while watching reruns of Scooby Doo.  Yes, laugh all you want, but I know there are others out there who feel exactly the same way.  Now, knowing how much of a chicken I am, I suppose I can get in to my review of Steven King's The Shining.  For the record I had to read this book for a class and I would have never read it otherwise, but I actually began reading it and couldn't put it down.  King has created a spellbinding story of a family and a hotel.  The Torrence family, as dysfunctional as they may seem, became my tie to the novel.  I felt like I was in that hotel with them, like I was one of Jack and Wendy's children.  Their son, Danny, was however the creepy one to me.  I have always been afraid of books, movies, even cartoons, where there is a child who seems to be ""different"".  Danny definitely fits the mold of the creepy little kid.  He has a power, ""The Shine"", that allows him to read people's minds, predict the future, send messages to other people, even make things happen just by thinking about them. Also, Danny can see ghost. Yes, GHOSTS! He has a ""friend"" Tony who is a ghost. He shows Danny signs and other visual representations of either good or evil that is to come.  The sign that troubles Danny the most is ""Redrum""  So he learns to read so he can decipher what it means.The novel pits the family against their new home, a huge hotel that has a history  that is almost as unbelievable as the ghosts that haunt it.  The ""Overlook"" is a hotel where Jack Torrence and his wife and son will be living for the winter.  High atop a mountain in the Rocky Mountains the Overlook becomes very inaccessible during the winter months. Jack's job is to maintain the hotel during the ""off-season"" time.  Throughout their stay there, the history of the Overlook begins to be chipped away by Jack, who is a writer and uncovers a secret scrapbook in the basement.  This novel layers information upon information to leave the reader feeling submersed in the terror of the lives of the Torrences.  First we are faced with the drinking problem Jack has, along with the child abuse, and the loss of his job due to his beating of a high school student. You also must remember the jagged history of the Overlook, with the multiple murders and high profile owners/visitors it has housed throughout the years.  It could also be called the ""hotel of many secrets"".  Jack and his family are the ones who must uncover this past and in the process must face their pasts also. There are many thematic choices in this novel that I find very evocative and intriguing.  I am very impressed by Kings ability to transcend the conventions of the genre and make a riveting storyline that you will be immersed in.  This novel will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first page until you finish all 464 pages of horror. From the scary landscape of the Overlook, to the flashbacks of the past, to the ghoulish woman in room 217, you will be scared no matter how many horror novels you have read.  If you want to be truly scared, read ""The Shining."" Though frightening it is a fabulous book.",5

"3467","Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder","Fraser's political agenda blinds her","M Arneson","1627792767","R333X5RHNGRMYK","1555449241","This book ought to be really good. It’s well-researched; it’s about an interesting subject; Fraser obviously really admires Wilder and writes passionately about it. But the book suffers a major flaw that makes it ultimately a failure: Fraser’s political agenda intrudes time and again into the book and infects her judgments on both Laura Ingalls Wilder and her daughter Rose Wilder Lane. By the end of the book, it’s become an almost monomaniacal focus condemning Lane, even for petty things, and this feature is so distracting that it contaminates Fraser’s biographical judgment.

Fraser’s a liberal, who has no compunction about making statements such as “Socialism…helped” farmers on the 19th century frontier or portraying the New Deal solely in terms of compassion for the poor. That’s fine—she’s entitled to her political viewpoint. But it leads her into making omissions no competent historian would make, such as entirely ignoring the critique of the New Deal as a system of cartels for big business. This is a critique even liberals have acknowledged at least a little bit. The Progressive Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis agreed with it, striking down a major part of the New Deal in the 1936 Schechter Poultry case, for instance. But it appears nowhere in Fraser’s book.

That’s important because both Laura Wilder and Rose Lane were intense critics of the New Deal. Lane, particularly, is a major figure in the history of libertarianism. But Fraser never, in her 500+ pages, even attempts to address Lane’s substantive criticisms of the New Deal—even to refute them. Instead, she just asserts that “more discerning” people support government welfare—and she resolutely portrays Lane’s political views as a function of alleged mental illness. Thus we’re told that Lane wrote against the New Deal out of “a personal sense of grievance against the federal government,” or that she opposed FDR because “she found it easier to locate villains outside herself.”

This sort of psychologizing is simply infantile. No doubt Lane was a complex and cantankerous figure, perhaps even unlikeable. But to ascribe her political beliefs to that does a disservice not just to Lane, but to Wilder, who, after all, agreed with her daughter. Fraser recognizes this, so she is forced time and again to portray Wilder as having not REALLY believed in free markets and limited government, or of having somehow been duped by her daughter—which is a demeaning and fundamentally antifeminist perspective, not to mention flat-out wrong. Laura Wilder was no pushover. Fraser’s hostility to Lane transforms into misogyny, in fact; Lane was a remarkably modern figure—a world-traveling independent journalist who refused to compromise her career dreams to settle down to married life; she deserves recognition at least as one of the pioneering female intellectuals of the 20th century—yet Fraser manages to transform this into a character flaw that springs from Lane’s lack of a conscience and failure to act out stereotypically female versions of compassion. This, Fraser says, proves there was something wrong with her. No ’20s chauvinist could’ve said it better. (This is also false; Lane sponsored, at considerable personal expense, the educational and careers of several young people she “adopted” as her own. Fraser manages somehow to make this still more proof of her lack of charity.)

Fraser’s portrayal of opposition to the New Deal as a psychological disorder also does a disservice to those who believe the New Deal was a good idea. That’s because it’s not coupled with any substantive discussion or defense of the New Deal. That’s because it’s not coupled with any substantive discussion or defense of the New Deal. It makes no effort to address its merits, but rests upon an emotionalistic caricature of history, with good guy New Dealers against the Snidely Whipash capitalists. And that leads her into some real whoppers—such as when she quotes Rose Lane’s saying that “the laws of Nature and of Nature’s God endow you with a right to life and liberty”—and then calls this a “nationalistic” statement, which is simply the opposite of the correct adjective, whatever one’s own opinion might be. Or her statement that the 1930s was “a time of the most widespread food insecurity Americans had ever known.” Assuming “food insecurity” means anything, surely Americans in, say, 1863 or 1837 or 1873 or 1620 faced worse, no? Or her statement that the Nineteenth Amendment “was the most important advance in civil rights in America since Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.” So much for the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments and the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1875. She says that the Ingallses failed as homesteaders—a disputable claim—and then says their generation were essentially duped into homesteading because nobody could really have succeeded at it—also dubious—but then praises Progressive era banking laws that “would have provided a lifeline” to the Ingallses by giving them “low-interest loans”—after just telling us what terrible credit risks they were. And she even claims that “the Chicago tribune [in 1877] urged homeowners pestered by [the homeless] to spike handouts with ‘a little strychnine or arenic’ and poison men as if they were vermin.” This is just not true. That article was a satire. But because it supports her cartoonish sterotypes of the Gilded Age, she falls for a hoax.

As for historical issues of greater subtlety, they’re far beyond Fraser’s ken. She criticizes Lane for giving Mussolini and Hitler some measured approval in the 1920s and early 30s—ignoring the fact that many conservatives did so, including Winston Churchill. Hardly proof she was a fascist. She praises Laura Wilder for saying that “If I had been the Indians I would have scalped more white folks before I ever would have left [the prairie],” by saying that this “was a startling statement for a woman of her day.” It wasn’t. Such sentimentalism and romanticism—which was certainly well-grounded—was commonplace throughout Wilder’s lifetime and before; see the works of James Fenimore Cooper, for instance.

Her vendetta against Lane also blinds her to BIOGRAPHICAL issues of greater subtlety. Time and again she condemns Lane (and more gently, Wilder) for introducing false or inaccurate anecdotes into their writing—most notably the anecdote about Almanzo narrowly escaping the notorious Bender family of serial killers. But she never addresses the way in which people tell family stories over the years. Families tell stories back and forth over the years and often forget what actually did happen; they don’t always double check their records for factual accuracy. Over generations, these tales evolve and expand, and become treasured, so that they become “lore.” We’ve all seen this happen. Maybe Wilder and Lane knew that the Bender story wasn’t true, but it’s also possible that these tales were told back and forth for so long that they became lore, and they themselves didn’t know what was true or not. In the 1930s, Laura openly said it wasn’t true. But the 50s, did she even remember this? Maybe, maybe not—and Fraser makes no effort to address this. She simply takes the fact that it wasn’t true as proof of Rose’s dishonesty. (The fact that Laura also repeated the story? That’s just proof of Rose’s nefarious influence.)

This sort of sloppiness—even cattiness—ruins the book, which degenerates into a redundant, superficial, attack on Lane and on the libertarian political movement in general. That’s nothing new to libertarians, of course—always the red-headed stepchild—but it’s so poorly done that it not only fails to persuade, but it ends up as neither a satisfying biography nor a satisfying critique of the ideas. I mean, for example, on pages 498-99, she criticizes, of all things, Rose Wilder Lane’s GRAVESTONE—which includes a passage from Thomas Paine’s Agrarian Justice—for being written in all capital letters. Seriously, she calls this “shouting,” and then says that her dear friend who chose the words, Roger Lea MacBride, “and conservatives like him,” “had not read” Agrarian Justice, which, she says, was an argument in favor of a welfare state. Even putting aside the petty nastiness of such comments, and this dubious characterization of Agrarian Justice, and her misrepresentation of MacBride as a conservative, when he was actually a libertarian, what proof does Fraser have that MacBride and Lane didn’t read Agrarian Justice? She certainly doesn’t provide any.

This book features page after page of such millimeter-deep partisanship.

What it ultimately is, is a failure of imagination. Fraser just can’t CONCEIVE of how someone could have opposed the New Deal in the 30s, and thinks it must just prove that Rose hated poor people, was mentally ill, and didn’t know anything about history (and that she manipulated or brainwashed her otherwise independent-thinking mom). What it really proves is that Fraser doesn’t know, and doesn’t care to learn, about the context of the subject she’s writing about or to understand Laura Wilder or Rose Lane as they understood themselves. That’s a disservice to them and to the reader—and it’s a disappointment, because we all deserve better.",4

The authors are magnificent. This is a true PAGE-TURNER.
I t is well supported that Tiger’s father was an mean alcoholic abuser of everyone that he dealt with. HE WAS CLEARLY A THUG, stopping at nothing to acquire what he wanted, he was a lier and a thief. The manner in which he, Tiger’s mother and Tiger treated Nike representatives is the worst display of hatred I have ever learned of.
EARL WOODS can be accurately compared to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.
Tiger has clearly followed in his father’s footsteps. His adoration and hatred for his father is like nothing I have ever learned of; all supported by the author’s incredible research. With good reason Tiger never gave his father a graveyard headstone; had he it would have certainly been blown up with explosives.
Tiger’s treatment of all others he came in contact with is identical to his father’s teachings; hate, cheat, screw anyone, literally and figuratively, that he could.
Tiger WAS great golfer. Tiger IS a horrible human.
I'm so glad I read this book; congratulations to the authors on outstanding research.
Additionally, to the same extent that Earl Woods is a thief and a thug, his mother is a hateful which! How can anyone hate and ridicule Phil Michelson the way which Kultida does? Her bragging that she has NEVER forgiven anyone dictates that she does not belong in our society; national or international.

While the book is structured around Gretchen Rubin’s five steps for decluttering and organizing, each page is a stand-alone, smart little tip.  (Yeah, I absolutely should have “donated quickly” back in January rather than moving my giveaway pile into the basement!)""Outer Order, Inner Calm"" is motivating because it’s realistic.  For example, using the methods in ""Outer Order,"" you can make some improvements to better your home even if you don’t have a lot of time.  Also, the cleaning methods and checklists don’t rely on convincing your partner or family to “do their part.”I love that ""Outer Order, Inner Calm"" proposes long-term habit changes to maintain order, such as strategic shopping, repairing broken items, and adding beauty to your home.  ""Outer Order"" also addresses work-life in addition to home-life (because work is a part of life!)If you’re interested in the KonMari method, ""Outer Order, Inner Calm"" is a great companion book.  Both Marie Kondo and Gretchen Rubin agree that the ultimate goal is happiness!  Personally, I like Marie Kondo’s “spark joy” concept, but I feel like part of the instructions are missing.  (The KonMari method seems to be easier to implement on ""Tidying Up,"" where the families can ask Marie Kondo questions to fill in the blanks!)  ""Outer Order, Inner Calm"" diagnoses many of my ongoing clutter problems and gives concrete solutions.  That pile of “not clean, but not dirty” clothes on the bedroom chair – put up a hook!I’d recommend ""Outer Order, Inner Calm"" to you if you like Marie Kondo but need more concrete and varied ideas on how to declutter, if other people rely on you to keep your home organized, if you want to declutter efficiently, or if you’re the type of person who needs an individual cleaning method.",5

"3580","Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder","Horribly Written, Filled with Speculation, Politics, and Bias","M Arneson","1627792767","R31U999FBPUZ4D","1555458620","This is a perfect example of how not to write a historical biography. This is one frustrating book to read because the author is such a poor writer and has no idea how to pull together a narrative storyline without going off on tangents or including her speculative opinions on virtually every page. The facts are here, but pulling together lots of printed information from 150 years ago does not a good story make. Instead the reader is forced to read over and over ""perhaps,"" ""maybe,"" ""could have,"" ""must have,"" ""probably,"" ""possibly,"" etc. So the writer is making up stuff as she goes along, trying to attribute characteristics to the Ingalls characters where there is no support for it.

The author also takes dramatic political stances that are inappropriate for this book. She uses early pages to try to condemn the movement of Indians out of Minnesota, failing to show any concern for the fact that hundreds of citizens of the new state were executed by Native Americans that refused to honor treaties. Certainly Indians were not treated well, but to use these bloated pages to preach that the settlers were the bad guys whose deaths seemed somehow justified is inexcusable.

This rambling text also lacks maps, charts, timelines, and other graphics that would have helped in the telling of the story. Because the writer insists on tossing in just about every minute detail that she found searching through historical records (including Ingalls that she's not sure are even related to Wilder!), the presentation of just words on a page make for tedious reading in spots and illustrations would have made stronger points.

Bottom line is that this person can't write well. Almost every sentence is clunky in a formal structure that seems outdated. She sounds like she's writing something from 150 years ago, and maybe that was the intent to match the tone of the Little House books. But if it was it's a mistake. At over 500 pages it's way too long with plenty of unnecessary historical information that has little to do with the Ingalls saga or that could be summarized in a paragraph instead of a chapter. The author's bias (working for the company that publishes the Little House books) hurts and an objective view of the material would have improved the content. It's hard to believe this book won awards because the well-written book about Wilder has yet to be written.",4

"3589","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","Extremely long book and although informative and descriptive, felt a bit exhaustive for my liking","D.P. McHenry","0143110438","R2J79SQE57WSC1","1555459102","My gf's and I decided to read this book for our book club and although I'm sure I will get a lot of backlash for this, we were not huge fans. I will admit, maybe the audience he was writing for was an older generation and maybe we were too young to really get it, that's fine. No author can appeal to everyone, but I am entitled to my opinion, so here goes...

I I'll start with the positives...the book was extremely descriptive and paints an excellent picture of what life was like for Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov forced to live in a hotel in Moscow for his entire life. Furthermore, the book it a bit of a history lesson and it was interesting to learn about what life was like in Moscow from the 1920s and onward. It was also written very well, and I felt more intelligent after reading it. It's written for a more educated and cultured reader, that's a definite. There's also a lot of lessons to be learned throughout the book from humility, compassion, endurance, self sacrifice, loyalty, and of course the power of love. I feel like many 'millennials' need to be taught some of these things! (Note, I myself am a millennial!)

On the other side, my goodness was this book long, 465 pages...I felt like it could have easily ended in under 350. I personally felt like the book really didn't get going until the little girl appeared, then things started getting interesting, and dramatic. Before then, it was very descriptive and yes, it painted a great picture of the count and all the other characters, the hotel, Moscow itself, why the count was there to begin with etc., but I found my mind drifting numerous times throughout all this. I had to put the book down numerous times. Lastly, some people loved the ending...I wasn't a huge fan. I felt I like I had climbed up a large mountain, spent hours upon hours hiking and came to a highway at the end of my hike, instead of a gorgeous view. Others may think differently, but I wasn't impressed!

I gather they will make this into a movie soon and I am interested to see how the movie will pan out and how well it will compare to the book. I would also love to see who would play the characters in the book.

Overall, I would give it a 3.5 out of 5...",5

"3652","Outer Order, Inner Calm: Declutter and Organize…","Inspiring, practical and funny","Amazon Customer","1984822802","R21CHD6EH3G7MZ","1555463886","I really enjoyed this book (I actually couldn't put it down).  Reading this book made me feel human and normal which is a good thing when it comes to something as draining and overwhelming as dealing with your life long acquired possessions. Sound, wise, practical advice this book even had me laughing out loud at some points.Highlights for me:The author points out that organizing is not the first step to creating outer order, getting rid of things is the first step. I like that the book starts out explaining that you have to ""make choices"" essentially what to keep and where to put it. I can be very indecisive at times so the fact that she points out that you need to make decisions is very logical and useful to me.The book lists questions to ask yourself to help make those choices and decisions easier.  Every item in your home or your space started out as a decision, in many cases a choice to buy or not to buy, as a person who shops too much this really spoke to me.The book is funny and really gets to the heart of human nature of how we often tie our emotions to our possessions even when it doesn't serve our best interests to do so. I laughed when she pointed out that you don't need ""two sifters"" I currently own two and that if you make your coffee in a Keurig then you don't need the French press (I currently own both AND an espresso machine.)Her ideas are concrete ""if you can't retrieve it you won't use it"" (espresso maker on the high top shelf that took up too much counter space).  ""Use it up, wear it out, make it work or do without""This book is easy to read, it's fun, its thought provoking and it gives you the green light to let go of guilt (which is a huge reason I personally feel obligated to keep things I never use.) I really have a deeper understanding as to why some items have been so difficult for me to let go of.I have read “ The Magic Art of Tidying Up” and I loved the concept “does it spark joy?” But found many of the other concepts overwhelming and strict and when I was incapable of implementing them perfectly I felt as though I had failed, feeling defeated I quickly gave up.In Outer Order Inner Calm “ There are no magic, one-size-fits-all solutions for establishing order; we all need to do it in the way that’s right for us.” This freed me from the guilt and fear of imperfection and is the exact type of encouragement that someone like me (who fears failure) needs to finally tackle my clutter. The book left me feeling hopeful and energized and I’m looking forward to putting what I’ve read into action.",5

"3677","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Stephen King is a Hack, but in a good way","C. CRADDOCK","198211598X","R3SJ5Q159D8UCM","1555465375","I always thought that Stephen King was a hack and recoiled in horror when his fans compared him to Poe and said one day he would be studied as a great writer of Literature.  Though that is never going to happen, King is nevertheless a great writer, a superb craftsman, and both Stephen King books I read were really good. The other book I read was called On Writing, and it is a sort of mini autobiography, memoir, and also a how to manual ""on writing."" I didn't always agree with his advice, but if you read the book, and don't try to condense things down to a few rules and aphorisms, he always allows for exceptions to every rule. Anyway, while he is writing mostly in the horror genre, that doesn't mean he neglects or ignores great Literature. In fact he says that it is essential to not only write every day, but to read as well. He reads 70 to 80 books per year, and there are all kinds of Literary allusions that he will drop in. The Shining was an excellent opportunity for him to do so, for the main character was a writer, in fact, a lot of the plot is driven by Jack Torrance's Writer's Block. As for Poe, there are parallels drawn with The Masque of Red Death and The Fall of the House of Usher.The movie is also really great, directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. The book and the movie are slightly different, but each is really great in its own way. But I digress. We are talking about the book here, and the fact that I have heretofore refused to read any books by Stephen King because I am such a Literary Snob, but now that I have read two King books, I discovered that he is a really a good writer after all. He spins a good yarn, and really knows how to create suspense. You find it is impossible to put down. The pages start turning themselves, as if they are are also haunted by the malevolent spirits of the Overlook Hotel. For instance, his son Daniel seems to possess second sight--the shining, that gives the book its title. Daniel has an imaginary friend named Tony, and after a series of paranormal experiences they take him to see a doctor. The doctor is skeptical of paranormal phenomena, but he is enough of a psychologist to note the significance of the name, ""Tony."" But what? I was wondering the same thing. King teases you with revelations of this sort. He piques your curiosity. As Jack Torrance says, ""Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought him back."" In his book On Writing he describes the story as an object that is being excavated, like an archeological relic. Still, Theme, Symbols, Jungian Archetypes, are often buried along with the story, and if you find such pearls and jewels, it would behoove you to polish them, and offer them in a splendid setting so they shine their brightest. A symbol that really shone for me in The Shining was the wasp nest. Later, during the climactic scenes, the snowmobiles racing to the Overlook were wasp-like, and oh, watch out for others, don't want to spoil the surprise, don't want to take out the sting. So, what was the significance of Danny's imaginary friend being named ""Tony?"" I am sworn to secrecy. You are just going to have to read the book.Redrum!",5

Then, about 1/2 way through, the book turns to Rose, Laura's daughter. While I understand that Rose played a huge part in getting Laura writing books, editing for her mother, etc.... I really was not interested in a blow by blow description of Rose's life. I felt like Rose's story should have been second to Laura's while still explaining the huge role she played.

He and his family will watch out for the place during the off-season.  Because of the winter weather, they know that they may be stranded there for weeks at a time.  This will give them all a chance to be together and also allow Jack to write the next great novel.  The hotel and its' permanent inhabitants have a different idea.The Shining is a frightening book.  Yes, it's scary because of all the paranormal things that happen with the hotel's ghosts.  More than that, it's scary because of Jack.  He wants to be a good man, husband, father, writer, etc.  But, you see, Jack has some anger management issues.  He was fired from his job as a teacher because of an altercation with a student.  He broke his son's arm in anger.  Jack is `ripe for the picking' as the one to do the dirty work for the ghosts.The Shining is also sad.  You could feel Jack's struggle.  He doesn't want to hurt anyone but his demons won't allow him to live a normal life.  One of his demons is alcohol.  Most of us know someone who is a different person when drinking.  Jack is that person.Danny, Jack's son, has some special powers.  He has ""the shining"" or ability to talk with others with his mind.

As a Q researcher from November 2017, I am extremely upset with the amount of holes in this book, the terrible organization, the usurpation of the phenomenon by “PAYTRIOTS”, and the usury of good patriots like Joe M. There is so much left to be desired.Also - major flaw - the glossary describes “AS” as Antonin Scalia, and while that is PARTLY correct, that is the ONLY initials in the glossary and it protects ADAM SCHIFF. That’s just one example.Q drops are cut short, interpretations are lacking or misleading - this only begs the question, WHO ARE THEY PROTECTING AND WHO IS BEHIND THIS? Amazon even deleted all the 1-star ratings. I will screenshot this as evidence Incase it’s removed as well.This book is a let down to the movement and a disappointment for America loving patriots.WWG1WGA has a deep meaning for me, and this book represents the opposite. It is simply opportunists trying to be the first out of the gates without any idea of the harm they’re doing. Edward Bernays taught in his propaganda teachings that the “first story out is the one people believe”, whether it’s true or not. The truth, from here, is an uphill battle and this book does NOT help.God bless all you patriots...I want my money back, and an explanation from all the “authors” (except Joe M - who took no money and was USED) as to why they are infiltrating the movement with garbage.This is the clear infiltration of the movement and it WILL NOT STAND.",1

Like others, I find the plethora of information about Rose to be dry and not especially illuminating. Historical books about LIW suffer from the fact that there are not many extant sources about Laura, Almanzo, Pa, Ma, Mary, Carrie, and Grace. Many (most?) of the letters that the family wrote after Laura left Dakota Territory were not saved which is a loss for all of us. Rose, on the other hand, was in public life for a large part of her life. The letters that she and Laura wrote back and forth were preserved. There is a great deal of fodder for historians to regurgitate regarding Rose. Therefore, that is what we get. We get more than enough to know that Rose was not a very nice person, and she may not have been very honest, either.

Nonetheless, the portion of the book that explains how, as settlers on the frontier, Pa and family made choices and lived with the consequences is well worth the time it takes to read and absorb it. Highly recommended!",4
"3787","A Visual Theology Guide to the Bible: Seeing and Knowing God's Word","Pretty, but ...","Chris Brooks","310577969","RZQQ6W62KZK8C","1555473661","This book is visual. It has a lot of pretty images. But what quality? To answer that, I'll ask what I expect will be common questions.Are the pictures different from what you'd find in other books? Largely, yes. Not all of them are terribly original, but the majority of them are.Is meaning of the visuals clear? Mostly. A few of them are pretty opaque, but they're a small percentage.Are the images useful apart from the text? Some of them. Some could be ripped out of the book and used as posters. Some are only clear in conjunction with the text. Some aren't clear even with the text. Some seem to have no bearing on the text.Do the pictures convey information better than text would? Most of them, no. Some of them so-so. A few of them very much so. The latter is what I wanted in this book. Sadly, it's only a handful of the visuals. Out of 200 pages, I find 9 graphics I can see myself using to teach this material.What about the text itself? It's pretty brief. They try to cover a lot of material in a very short amount of time and don't manage to accomplish a lot. For example, the section on the formation of the NT canon uses few words and a few unexplained images that end up defeating their purpose. Another example is the section on how to study the Bible -- it's too brief, though their visual on application is going on my wall.My verdict is that this book could be a tool to teach the material, but it's not something I could just hand to someone. It has a few fantastic graphics, a few good ones, and quite a few meh ones. So is it worth the money? I guess it depends on what you want it for. If you want to hand it to a student, no. If you want to cut it up and use certain pages as visual aids, maybe. If you want pretty images, maybe something to give you ideas of what you might do yourself, yes.This is a new style of book trying to reach the next generation by speaking their language, and for that the authors should. be commended, but in the end I think they put the visuals over the message.",3

"3794","American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space Race","Going to Moon Was Hard; Reading American Moonshot is Easy","M. Bailey","006265506X","R21GQT1YAWMQVM","1555474464","The Space Age has also been the Television Age, so, of course, John F. Kennedy met Wernher von Braun late in 1953 in the Pathe’ Studios green room (or whatever they called it then) in New York. Kennedy was freshman senator and von Braun was running the Army’s rocket program. Kennedy told von Braun how his brother had been killed in an operation related to the German V-weapons and the two discussed the new challenge from the Soviets and importance of ballistic missiles. They would remain friends for the rest of Kennedy’s life, although von Braun would beat Kennedy to national television renown with his appearances on the “Disneyland” series about space travel.

And that casual meeting would put the United States on a course to the moon.

Douglas Brinkley’s “American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space Race” does for Kennedy and the space program what he did with Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt the environment. The progress of rocketry parallels with Kennedy’s career until they would interact so fatefully in 1961.

Brinkley’s thesis is that the moon landing would have taken place much later without Kennedy’s determination to set a “hard” goal and carry it through. After the initial cheering for a moon landing “before this decade is out,” Congress began to waver. Ike came out of retirement to oppose Apollo and Goldwater wanted the Air Force take over space operations. LBJ was always strong for manned space flight, but perhaps not willing to go quite as boldly as Kennedy (he would as faithfully carry on Kennedy’s Apollo legacy as he did his civil rights legacy).

Even those familiar with Kennedy and Apollo will find fresh threads in “Moonshot.” While still in the Navy, Kennedy took private flying lessons. Then there’s the expression “Moonshot” itself, which was coined by Dodger announcer Vin Scully to describe not very deep fly balls hit by Wally Moon that nevertheless cleared the forty-foot high screen the Dodgers put up to prevent cheap shot home runs in the L. A. Coliseum, where the left field stands were only 250 feet down the line.

Kennedy’s interest in space flight grew as the program developed. John Glenn went on beyond the schedule as Kennedy kept asking questions, so he offered to come back with models to help explain in more detail. The meeting was scheduled at once and he would not only return with the models, but also get an invite to the famous dinner for Nobel Prize winners (one of the few details Brinkley leaves out). He became a virtual member of the Kennedy family to the point of being asked by Ethel Kennedy to comfort the children back in Virginia when Bobby was shot in California. When they hit off immediately, Alan Shepard became another Kennedy favorite.

The much cited Rice University speech (“we choose to go to the moon and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard”), now perhaps as familiar as the Inaugural (or indeed any bit of public rhetoric since World War II), marked the culmination of multi-day tour of NASA facilities across the South. At every stop, Kennedy asked question after question, overstayed the schedule, delighted in the technology and, in the case of von Braun, talked him into continuing the conversation on Air Force One, en route to Florida and a visit to Cape Canaveral.

Kennedy saw the space program as both an adventure producing heroes to be admired – the astronauts were his kind of guys – and a way to jump start American technology for the latter half of the 20th Century. And incidentally, bring high tech to parts of the Southeast. By the fall of 1963, Apollo was well on its way. Kennedy would look over the Gemini craft under development in St. Louis, see the firing of an early version of the Saturn engine and check out the Manned Spaceflight Center in Houston. There he got into a long conversation with Gordon Cooper and invited him to accompany him to his next stop. Cooper had to beg off – he was participating in an important, long-scheduled test the next day.

So Kennedy went to Dallas without him.",5

I’d been having a good chat with myself for several months by the time I received an ARC of I Miss You When I Blink, a family meeting if you will- albeit with only one family member in attendance.

Without going into too many details, I’d been working a job that I loved more than anything, until I didn’t. Things changed and they changed quickly. I knew about two days into the school year that it was time to move on.

""You can stand by your past decisions even if they took you to a present where you don’t belong anymore.""

Yes, yes, yes! I felt so full of gratitude for the events, people, and situations that crossed my path and changed me, but it was long past time to hike a different trail- perhaps a moderately rugged one this time, preferably near a lake, yoga studio, or independent bookstore…

I started applying for jobs, filling in general applications so that when hiring season came upon me, I could click on specific positions and hit “submit”. Then I received a phone call. The principal and I spoke on the phone for well over thirty minutes, both driving home from work, and I knew that she was the person I wanted to work for. She offered to meet over coffee. I turned her down. I couldn’t leave mid year.

In the words of Mary Laura, “This is the book when you’re feeling like, ‘What the hell am I going to do with my life?’ and you need to know you’re not alone.” A memoir in essays, Mary Laura will inspire you to get on that elliptical machine, look at where you came from, see how you’ve outgrown your current situation, and kick some serious ass in the next big adventure!

""But our lives aren’t one suspended moment, a single either-or choice; they’re a string of moments, a string of choices.""

A month later, I emailed the principal and asked if the position was still available. I interviewed, I met with the superintendent. Seven days after turning in my letter of resignation I found myself in another state, lounging by a hotel pool, because my apartment wasn’t available yet and there was a snow day on my first day of school.

The book is Jenny Lawson meets Brene Brown- only WAY better! It’s one of the few that made me actually laugh out loud, but it also made me cry. It’s about being real and vulnerable. You can be some fancy pants lady getting paid to read books in your beautiful home wearing cozy socks designed for running that actually do quite well for sitting, but you also have to deal with medical scares, job loss, bills, and turtles knocking on your door. Life is work for everybody and “Nobody’s path is as linear as it looks in retrospect.”

I drafted this blog post months ago never anticipating that I would be working my dream job while living walking distance from Lake Michigan, a five minute drive to a yoga studio, and within 30 minutes of an independent bookstore that doubles as a live music venue, coffee shop, and wine bar. Best of all, I’m near family. My soul has always been in Michigan and it feels so good to be home.

Please read this, or… better yet- let’s read it together with brie salad sandwiches, carrot cake, and wine!",5

As an example would be the Charlottesville situation.The president said: You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. … You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, — to them — a very, very important statute and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down statutes to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think about Thomas Jefferson? Do you like him? Are we going to take down his statute? Because he was a major slave-owner. Now are we going to take down his statute? You’re changing history. You’re changing culture, and you had people — and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally — but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.""Yet the author continuously takes this sentence out of context as if were ALL that the president said: ....""you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. …""  That's an example of inferior reporting, bias and a slanted narrative. Her reporting is about as real and authentic as the air-brushed photo of her on the back cover. It absolutely looks nothing like how she does in real life, with her asymmetrical nose and mouth, thinned out hair and middling features. While she airbrushed herself so that she does not even resemble her real life face, she airbrushes her words and narrative in the opposite direction, to make Kushner and his family and Ivanka and her family look as bad as she possible can. That offends my sense of honesty and ethics.All that being said, from what I know of Kushner including the compilation of events recounted in this book, I do believe unequivocally that Kushner should leave the White House-- as soon as possible.",2

For over ten years from 1974 to 1986, a sadistic predator roamed the night committing approximately fifty sexual assaults in Northern California and ten murders in Southern California. All of these crimes were only tied together later by the advancement of DNA.Three decades later, Ms. McNamara, who was a true crime journalist with her own cold case blog, began an intensive search for the faceless man she dubbed “The Golden State Killer”. Her passion for justice shows in all of her writing. Sadly, Ms. McNamara died before she was completely finished with this book, but her research assistant and a fellow true crime writer pulled the remainder of the information together to finish this work of her lifetime for publication.This is an intriguing true crime book that was left as an open mystery the authors hope will lead to the discovery of the faceless Golden State Killer.***(Update: This book was published in February, 2018 and in April, 2018 authorities announced the arrest of 72 year old Golden State Killer suspect Joseph James DeAngelo on eight counts of first degree murder based on DNA evidence.)",5

A well-developed plot that carries you through seamlessly and doesn't bog you down (something that King seems to struggle with at times). Good use of vernacular language that makes the reader feel as if he/she is ""in the story"", walking alongside the characters themselves, keeping the tale entertaining. A great use of folklore/mythology (the scenes in the dark woodlands where the Wendigo stalks its victims scared the bajeezus out of me).

Is she Sheryl Crow? Now that I think of it, I wasn't very fond of Karen, either. Perhaps the only sympathetic female character is Camila - I found her real and amazing. Warren is hilarious, Billy is noble, Eddie has a huge chip on his shoulder. Jenkins-Reed seems to know a lot about the recording industry, and the song lyrics at the end are a special bonus, as is discovering where each of the characters go after walking away, not always wilingly, from the success.

"3912","When We Left Cuba","Completely captivating!","Rachel M","045149086X","R3MLKRMQFZTBDP","1555482363","This was such a wonderful story! I really enjoyed Chanel Cleeton's Next Year in Havana so I was really excited to learn that one of my favorite characters in that book would get to tell her own story. This is that story. The events in this book take place after those in Next Year in Havana and while I enjoyed seeing all of the characters again, this story stands on its own. I was hooked by this story from the very beginning and had a fantastic time with this book.

This is really a big story. Beatriz and her family are living in Florida after fleeing Cuba when Castro came into power. The family has suffered a lot of losses and it has been a difficult adjustment. Beatriz and her family hope to go back to Cuba but are also trying to make a life in Florida. Beatriz's mother would like to see all of her daughters married but Beatriz has other ideas. She has turned down quite a few marriage proposals and is more focused on revenge.

This story was filled with excitement. Beatriz works with the CIA and let's just say that her life is far from boring. She was passionate about the cause that she was working towards and it was really quite interesting to see her in action. Some of her missions were more exciting than others but it was great to see her in action.

I was really taken by the romance in this story. It was not your average romance and I am actually somewhat surprised that I was so taken with it but I just found myself swept away by their chemistry. Nick and Beatriz were just great together. They were incredibly attracted to each other and couldn't seem to stay apart even when they tried. There were so many things that seemed to work against the possibility of a relationship between them but they just couldn't stay away from each other. There were things about their relationship that made me sad and I wouldn't necessarily say everything turns out well but I think they were both better for knowing each other.

I really enjoyed the politics and history that were a part of this book. This was such an eventful period of time and I loved seeing some of the events that I have learned about worked into this story. I thought that all of the little details that the author included really added to the authenticity of the story.

I would highly recommend this book to others. This was a captivating story about a passionate character working to make a difference in the world while trying to find some happiness for herself. I cannot wait to read more from this talented author.

I received a digital review copy of this book from Berkley Publishing Group via NetGalley.",5

Most of the book is about breeds and cuts, grills and fuel, and methodology. That’s all well and good, but it makes up 90% of the book and the remaining recipes are few and uninspired. There’s a basic vinaigrette, sautéed mushrooms, mixed vegetables, a salsa verde recipe and a few variations on potatoes and not much else. The recipe ingredients are few aren’t overly complicated, which leads me to think “Why do I need this?” Recipe wise, there’s nothing I can’t find elsewhere and actually little I’d make. There is for instance a recipe for “raw tomatoes” which is basically tomatoes with salt and pepper.

It is a story in which teenagers don’t show a spark of rebellion and adults cling desperately to the status quo. In my experience, it is totally inauthentic, and I had no interest in sharing a world with these people. Scottoline is a serviceable writer so I moved through the chapters quickly, but even so I found myself skipping to the end and was able to tie up all the loose ends efficiently by omitting two thirds of the book. Now obviously, if you like this kind of book, that is not something you would choose to do, but I have discovered I will never be a fan of this author or genre so I will be even more efficient in the future and skip her books completely.",5

After going through it I was happy to find plenty of recipes to try where I either didn't need to buy anything or could easily use extras for other recipes (ex. flax seeds, dried fruits, nuts).
I've been quite lazy lately with my first meal of the day only eating cereal or skipping it all together, so the breakfast and smoothie recipes were what called to me most. From the book I made:
Rock+Roll granola
Tuscan Glow Smoothie
Superfood Galaxy oatmeal
Simply almond butter smoothie
Competitive coffee smoothie
I enjoyed each of these recipes. The only one that gave me a problem was the Rock+roll granola. It quickly turned dark even though I stirred it at the 10 minute mark and checked again after another 10. At the minimum of 20 minutes it was slightly burnt. I was even in the kitchen and didn't smell anything burning. Either way I'm still eating it. The ingredients are yummy and I'd make it again at a lower temp.
As another reviewer mentioned this is a compilation cookbook, and there are plenty of recipes with ingredients I've never heard of before. While there is an ingredients section in the beginning of the book it does not go over the more obscure ingredients. For example the Libido smoothie uses maca powder with no explanation to what it's for. But if you look at the boosted cbd coffee it mentions using maca powder for energy. I just wish the ingredient section was a bit more thorough.
Over-all I enjoyed the recipes I tried and will continue to cook from Well+Good (hopefully a few recipes not for breakfast!)
Thanks for the free book Clarkson Potter.",4

Wonderful information on the strong women of Jeju, who provide for their families by diving naturally in the surrounding waters for delicacies.  They are called Haenyeo.  This is the story of Young-sook and Mi-ja - two young women and their families as they grow up on the Island.I did love this novel.  There are some slow parts - but I can now see those parts as building blocks to the understanding of the story.  Lisa See's extensive research is evident and her ability to weave a story is exceptional  Tragic is the come away feeling of this novel.  At first profound friendship then severe hurt and loss.  Forgiveness is another theme with one character giving and looking for forgiveness and the other not able to forgive.I came away from this novel with a sense of how not being open enough to find out the whole story, both sides of the story can lead to a waste in one's life. Hurt feelings can devastate and change your world.  One should strive to be as open in hurtful and overwhelming situations as possible - not always an easy thing to do but something to struggle for - it could change your life - as it could of Young-sook's!

This one, the prequel to The Lilac Girls, is set in WWI, and follows the characters of Eliza Ferriday, Sofya Streshnayva, her Romanov cousin and good friend, and Varinka, a young peasant girl hired by Sofya.

Character development is again wonderful, and it's interesting to view the overthrow of Tsarist Russia from viewpoints within the family, through the eyes of an American concerned for her good friend, and through the eyes of a peasant girl with ties to both Sofya and the revolution.

Kelly's descriptive skills make the reader feel equally a part of the Russian royal social life before the war, the impacts of the war on Russia's people, and the response of Americans.

War takes its toll on the world, and Kelly once again weaves a story with people we come to care about who show us the price paid on several fronts.

Knowing that there was a sequel on the horizon, this time told from possibly the most famous and notorious Perez girl, I knew it would be one of my top reads for the year and I'm happy to report I wasn't wrong.

Filled with strife, and heartache but also love and friendship, When We Left Cuba will completely take readers breath away with the seamless way Cleeton once again weaves through history both past and present in a time when the world was being torn apart but so many events and conflict.

The author once again proves that she can write about a history that many of us don't know about and makes us all care deeply about it and want to learn more, until we are so engrossed with the story and the characters themselves that it changes us all. The way we think, they way we feel and most of all, changes our perspective on how we view the world and those around us.

This character seemed so well adjusted and even-keeled, benignly accepting his circumstances.

It’s about sharing moments around a table with our loved ones; and even better: sharing unforgettable smells, textures and flavors from warm, sweet - almost soothing- cakes. Throughout the entire book I felt like Odette had invited me to eat at her table on a warm Sunday afternoon, and I hope you’ll feel the same because that’s the pure joy of a great cookbook.I was very lucky to receive this treasure in form of a book in advance — and thank you so much, @tenspeedpress for the free book!— so I had plenty of time to read and bake many of those remarkable cakes. And because of that I’m here to tell you from the bottom of my heart that if you’re as passionate as I am for cakes you should really buy this book and keep it forever. And if you aren’t, that’s ok too, because soon you will catch yourself in the middle of the day thinking about which of the recipes would be the most suitable for the dessert after dinner.I’ve been baking so often because those recipes are really simple yet special. You can make as much combinations as you want, it’s a real mix and match. And that’s great! I don’t always have all the ingredients in my pantry, so I can really get creative with Odette’s suggested combinations while keeping following the recipes properly.Everything about this books is stunning! The protographs, the colors, the stories behind the recipes, everything!I’ve prepared almost all the recipes and I have to say: once you try the Almond Gató (see my pic) there’s no turning back! It’s one of the most delicious cakes I’ve ever had! And I was so surprised how easy it was to bake, so for experienced bakers or not, there’s is no way you won’t end up with something delicious. the Milk and Honey Cake is also sublime and it is, from now on my number one recipe for a white simple cake. Oh, and please, pleeease try the Raspberry Curd; it’s food for angels!!!",5

All the POV characters are engaging and the palace Intrigue angle works well. Unfortunately I find it paced not quite as well as previous entries, with a little less momentum than in earlier books. In particular, the will they / won't they with Alex and Bobbie once they get their hands on the XXXXXX seems to go on for ages.  Durante as well seems oddly used after last time.

"4125","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","retelling of Hitchcock's Rear Window","Amazon Customer","62678426","RCT89SATFEXGI","1555514396","2.5 starsRetelling of Rear Window(1954) with James Stewart and Grace Kelly, minus the charm... this round the housebound main character is an unlikable female agoraphobic and former child psychologist who has given up on the outside world after a tragic event.  She drinks too much wine, is whacked on meds, possibly hallucinating, pushy AF, lurks a great deal on the Internet, and spends an obnoxious amount of time being a smack-worthy nosy neighbor via her windows... a seemingly unreliable narrator who may or may not have witnessed a murder by her neighbor across the way.Kind of a despicable protagonist I never really took to.  Helpless and weak.  Her judgement is extremely poor--outright stupid-- and this made me wish she'd get institutionalized or that someone would just take her out.  Her ""Dr."" title was farcical.  Moreover, unlike Rear Window, no one here in this cast takes the place of Grace Kelly (who had more of a spine for a 1954 woman than the hot mess in this 21st century book)... just meh chemistry with Bina (a woman who shows up for exercise), neighbor Jane Russell, her tenant David, and Ethan, the teenage neighbor.  Grace Kelly's dynamic with the older Stewart as they chat and scheme and occasionally fool around was one of the best things about the movie.  This here is just some old movie fanboy fanfic. Though much like Rear Window... one does wonder why people don't close their dang blinds when they're up to no good!!!  Who is that dumb????  Implausible!!!  This book picks up the worst of Rear Window and ignores the best.  I just didn't care about any of these people.I did like all the descriptive language and all the nods to old movies, though.  ""Jane Russell"" was a nice touch, ha ha.  Nothing particularly original here plot-wise but engaging enough plot (I didn't say characters) due to the competent writing.  It's a serviceable retelling that could make for a half decent new movie based on the old (author already has a movie deal)... but ultimately telling of Hollywood's inability to come up with new material.  Does it rate all the attention it's getting?  Nope. Just one of those new releases that goes viral but isn't really great or original... amazing how often this happens.  An okay read but definitely overhyped.  If you look at the author's résumé you'll see he's gotta have friends in high places... you do the math.",3

"4129","Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland","A Must Read","Darcia Helle","385521316","RP9HKTDGOWZ7K","1555514808","We humans are predisposed to less visceral reactions toward tragedy within the masses than toward the tragedy of a few individuals. Learning, in broad terms, about the IRA and the struggles within Northern Ireland is an intellectual experience. We feel bad, but in a distant manner. Personalizing the history with the stories of a few people who were directly involved in and/or affected by the situation gives us an emotional connection, and then we're able to truly understand and empathize. With Say Nothing, Keefe gives us that emotional connection.All that is my long-winded way of saying I loved this book. I understand the situation in ways I didn't before, not just because I read the facts, but because I felt the impact.The piece of history presented here is complex, and yet the author does a fabulous job, not so much of simplifying events, but of presenting them in a way that's easy to follow and keeps us engaged.Patrick Radden Keefe is a gifted writer. I have no doubt that the research alone was exhausting, much less the process of putting it all together in an engaging narrative, and yet I never felt the weight of it. This is an exceptionally well written book that I highly recommend to anyone even remotely interested in the topic.*I received a free copy from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.*",5

Much like The Man of Steel's anthology, The Caped Crusader's collection includes a series of comics from over the years and short essays by the writers and artists who have helped create the mythos over the decades. These short pieces share personal memories and overall thoughts on Batman's legacy and his connections to American culture.#27, 30, 38, 66, 140. The introduction of The Batman, Robin, Two-Face, and The Riddler. These examples from The Golden Age serve to introduce the reader to a character who at this point is mostly a sleuth and do-gooder. I found this section a great look back at the origins of the art style, the allies, and the villains. My grandmother did not keep a huge stash of my father's comics, but I remember one book from the early 50s that contained a Riddler story. I have great memories of stealing away in the sunroom to read through these books growing up.The turning point of this collection in design and content is at #400, ""Challenge of the Man-Bat."" We see a break away from standard panelling and a real evolution of the motivations of the villains and the mission of The Batman himself. At this point the writers start to turn the camera both inward to Batman's own psychological issues and outward to comment on social issues in America. From here, the franchise grows and with it the audience.This collection forced me to reflect on my relationship with The Dark Knight. Why has he retained his popularity for so many years? Why do I follow him more closely than Superman? I believe I am like most people in that I appreciate his humanity, his pain, and his dark and brooding demeanor. This won't be a debate on Superman vs Batman because there have been just too many of those over the years, but I do find myself drawn to Batman, and this book helps to verify that.Like Superman's anniversary edition last year, this is another awesome tribute to one of the titans of the comic world.",4

If you’re confused, you’re not alone. In this epic, absorbing biography of her great-grandmother, Fraser tells us. Between her congenial narrative and careful, detailed documentation, this author has created a masterpiece. Lucky me, I read it free and early thanks to Net Galley and Henry Holt Publishers.

Laura’s early life was considerably harder than the sepia-toned, heartwarming stories with which she recounts it. Little children could not stand to hear the grueling poverty and crushing losses her family sustained.

“Her autobiographical novels were not only fictionalized but brilliantly edited, in a profound act of American myth-making and self-transformation. As unpublished manuscripts, letters, and documents have come to light, we have begun to apprehend the scope of her life, a story that needs to be told, in its historical context, as she lived it. That tale is different from the one she wrote. It is an adult story of poverty, struggle, and reinvention—a great American drama in three acts…Showing American children how to be poor without shame, she herself grew rich.”

Wilder was a legend unto herself, a fierce, strong woman that could survive anything, anything, and everything. Her story recounts not only personal hardships, but the wide sweeping history that she lived through, from the Westward movement and Manifest Destiny to the suffrage movement, the Dust Bowl, and the Great Depression, as well as the elephant in the room: Indian removal and genocide.

The book, some 600-plus pages, recounts not only Wilder’s story, but that of her daughter, Rose Ingalls Wilder, who was, frankly, a real piece of work. Their lives were so intensely intertwined that to do this any other way would render Wilder’s story incomplete. And I appreciate the scholarly objectivity with which Fraser treats her subject; it’s not without warmth, but she is clearly not manipulating facts, as some authors do when writing about famous relatives.

And although I previously named a different title as the go-to biography of 2017, I have to recognize that Fraser’s book is a contender. Highly recommended.",4

Check! Despair? Tragedy? Helplessness? Check, check, check! Like Gone Girl, The Girl On The Train, and The Couple Next Door, this book has a female protagonist with major issues, most of them brought upon by herself. The main difference is that the author this time is a male, who actually suffered from depression, so he knows how it feels to experience anxiety, loss, and helplessness. Good references to Hitchcock and other classic thrillers add depth to the read, though I figured out one of the three “big” reveals quite early on. I did expect a tad more action and suspense towards the resolution, which is why I’m giving it 4 out of 5 stars. For me, not quite as engaging as Gone Girl, but definitely more of a good read than The Death of Mrs. Westaway.

I grew up on the books and the TV show. I feel like the author was trying to decide how she felt about Laura Ingalls Wilder and Rose Wilder Lane and that her opinion kept changing.

I also feel like I did not come off learning anything I had not already read about the Ingalls family...granted it was a variety of books not just one.

If you loved the book series and have not done a lot of reading on the characters as real people this is a great book. If you have done a lot of reading on the characters as real people, this is a good book.

I really enjoyed this book. It is very clear that Caroline Fraser researched her topic very carefully and final work was outstanding. I appreciated all of the history intertwined with Laura's history and then intertwined with her fiction. I agree with other reviewers that it would have been more comprehensive if the pictures and even some of the documents referenced were included with the book. The topics were so thoroughly detailed that to view those items would have been the icing on the cake.

I have never been been a huge fan of Rose based on prior books. This book just reinforced that opinion.

One question that someone might know that I've missed - when Pa died, why were Ma and Mary living on maintenance income per 'Prairie Fires'? Given all of the funds being shared between Laura and Rose and what appeared to be the Wilder's' self-sufficiency, it doesn't seem out of line that Laura would have assisted.",4

Even without hearing the songs, however, you will feel as if you can. You will read the lyrics and become convinced that you hear the songs. THAT is the genius of Taylor Jenkins Reid is.The oral history approach never once feels like an ongoing inner monologue. You never think that you’re too deep into a character’s head. You never feel as if nothing is happening. You never wish there was more action. The story begins with a chapter that immediately fills you with intrigue and it does not let up, even when you turn the last page. The pacing, character development, and plot progression are perfection. THAT is the genius of Taylor Jenkins Reid is.It is difficult to pick a favorite character because each of them feels so real. Even Eddie, that whinging, glass-is-half-empty guitarist, earns your affection because you understand why he feels so frustrated. You might have been an Eddie in your life, working hard, using your skills and talents, only to receive nothing in return. Sometimes his complaining gets on your nerves, yet you feel like you know this guy. THAT is the genius of Taylor Jenkins Reid is.When you finish the book, you immediately want to re-read it again. You miss the characters, and you need to spend more time with them. On every page, they become real. Whether Daisy’s broken soul or Billy’s desperation or Graham’s huge heart, Karen’s ambivalence, Warren’s humor, or Pete’s mystery, you feel as if you were on a tour bus, hanging out with friends. THAT is the genius of Taylor Jenkins Reid is.The romance in this book takes many forms. The most dominant, of course, is love of music, its healing powers, its universal language. There is also the love between siblings, the love between friends, and the love of parents for their children. Romantic love, too, of course, but that comes in as many different melodies as music. Sometimes romantic love is simple and straightforward, and other times the notes are discordant, their tempo and volume ever changing. And sometimes romantic love begins with both hands playing the melody but one hand removes itself. THAT is the genius of Taylor Jenkins Reid.I loved this book. I hope you read it, and I hope you come back, hit up the comments, and tell me what you thought. Meanwhile, I’m going to go listen to the audiobook. I can’t get enough of Daisy Jones & the Six.",5

The plot is derivative and the writing style so overwritten and self conscious. Not a spoiler as you read it in the blurb anyway, but she takes photos of everything and yet the ONE thing she was meant to take a photo of, even though she has the camera in her hand, she doesn't. Too implausible. I didn't buy it.I cannot believe the editor did not strike at least half the similes and metaphors with a big red pen. Hundreds and hundreds of similes that make no sense but are just pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I love flowery writing and a beautiful simile, but when it's simply there for its own sake, all it does is draw attention to itself (in a bad way) and get in the way of the story.Reading this book is like sitting next to a man drenched in too much cologne but thinks he smells gorgeous and is trying to flirt with you. A little goes a long way, but too much is cloying and sickly.Examples: ""Her bathrobe marked the floor like skid marks"" Does the author not know what skid marks mean in UK English?

by Caroline Fraser (Author)

Where did the Ingalls come from? Why did they really leave their Little House in the Big Woods? Why did Pa keep relocating his family, starting afresh, again and again? What happened to their extended family? Did wolves really run with Pa and besiege their home? How did that Homesteading Act work, could you really get free land? Why did Pa's farming always fail? Did Laura really love Almanzo, and what happened to them after their marriage? Why did they only have one child? How did they end up in Missouri, and how did they manage to keep that farm? Why did Laura start writing, and did she get rich? Did her daughter really write all the books? Are they racist? How conservative are they, and what is the connection to the Libertarians? Where do the profits go today?

My background: I read all the LIW books as a child, and had them read to me. We watched the TV show. As an adult I read the entire series to my children. Twice. And I'll read them again for my youngest. The books I read are my wife's, from her childhood, falling apart, read to death. I pre-ordered the annotated autobiography ""Pioneer Girl"" and devoured it. And I leapt at the chance to read and review this new biography. I live in the heart of the ""Big Woods."" An hour's drive East of my house is Pepin, site of the Little House. An hour south is Spring Valley where Almanzo's family lived. The Zumbro river runs under my porch and canoeing downstream takes me to South Troy where Laura and her cousins waded, and where baby Freddie is buried.

As an adult I wondered about the ""real Laura"" and I learned much from the annotated Pioneer Girl, Laura's original autobiography. But that book is dominated by Laura's narrative, and there's only so much that editorial commentary can correct or expound when entire facets of her life were simply omitted. In any case, Pioneer Girl ended at Laura's marriage, at the very beginning of her long adult life.

Enter Caroline Fraser and ""Prairie Fires,"" a biography of two women, a textual history of their work, and the historical context of their times skillfully interwoven as a narrative. It is no exaggeration to call this a tour de force! The author has apparently made it her life's work (e.g. The Prairie Queen, New York Review Books, circa 1994) to learn everything that can be known about Laura Ingalls Wilder, including her family, her daughter, her times, and even the natural history of the Midwest. Reading this is to journey with Pa, Laura, Almanzo and Rose from the pioneering days of breaking prairie sod, through the 1890's depression, the populist era, the roaring twenties, the depression, WWII, and into the recognizably modern 1950's.

Prairie Fires starts strong, with genealogical research harking back to the colonial Pilgrim era, then flashing forwarding to the Dakota War of 1862 (a skirmish of which wiped out the Dustin family just ten miles from my childhood home, six months *after* the mass-execution at Mankato). As an aside, I don't think I've ever read a more fair exposition of that war, and the book is practically worth the price for that chapter alone. In this case the clichés are quite true: there was ample blame on all sides, but the Dakota lost and so they got the worst of it in the end.

From a formidable opening Ms. Fraser runs to strength on strength. For me the book was literally a page turner, I couldn't put it down, took it on vacation, read it in every spare moment, several times hiding in the bathroom just to get to the end of a chapter. I lost sleep, and got really clean from taking long baths. I finished it in ten days. The writing is so good I literally choked at the end, me, a grown man. It answered all the questions I had, and many I never knew I had. Along the way I learned more American history and began to understand just how and why families like the Ingalls went to the frontier. In my mind Laura Ingalls Wilder left ""fairyland"" and came into the real, recognizable world.

But Prairie Fires is not only about Laura, spilling a considerable amount of ink on her daughter Rose Lane, a very unflattering picture: selfish, immoral, manipulative, petty, mentally ill (manic depressive), dishonest, modestly talented, irreligious (flirting with Islam her whole life), plagiarizing, economically incompetent, politically hypocritical, casually anti-semitic. In a word: a fraud. For all that, we get glimpses of her intermittent success. Lane moved in fairly high political and literary circles, made her living by her writing and would have lived well but for her financial naivety. Without Rose's efforts it's safe to say we would not have Laura's beloved books at all, and Ms. Fraser is a fair reporter for letting that be known.

Yet she comes across as having an ""axe to grind"" against Lane. You will finish Prairie Fires in no doubt whatsoever about the absurdity of charges that Rose Lane ghost-wrote the LIW series, and you will wonder how it was possible for such a hack to ever make a dime as an author. Ms. Fraser seems generally in favor of collective politics, supportive of Roosevelt's New Deal programs, and bothered by Wilder's criticism thereof. She spends a great deal of energy detailing the misguided attempts by Laura's successors to corral her work into the Conservative/Libertarian cause, and in this she is somewhat successful. But her attempts to explain away the fundamental reasons why people like Laura Wilder resented the very New Deal programs intended to help them come across as feeble and condescending. We read somewhat about a religious heritage of independence going back to the Pilgrims, resentment of land use decrees, and crop destruction. But we hear again and again and again the litany of supposed hypocrisies: the homestead act was a Government Program after all, everyone necessarily took jobs off the farm, the bank where Laura worked administered Government Lending, the frontier was only open thanks to the Army, Pa cheated the Railroad, Almanzo lied on his Homestead Application... and that's about it. It's a mighty thin list to set against decades of hard toil, thrift and scrupulous morality, and it doesn't bear the weight of being Exhibit A in Wilder's Real Politics On Trial.

However, for all that, I'm prepared to be charitable. It's fair to say that while the LIW books may be conservative, they are not Conservative in the modern Far Right sense. Given the attempts of politicians to corral them into their cause, it's forgivable for someone who loves them to over-inoculate against the corresponding charge that they are little better than racist propaganda for Trumpian America. For the sake of readers worldwide, I can excuse Ms. Fraser's going a little over the top.

Oh, and about all those questions? Get the book to get the answers. Happy reading!",4

"4351","The Mister","Good","The Guide To Romance Novels","1984898329","R335OKH96TY6EG","1555580347","I bought this book because I like the way this Author writes. (Go ahead and jump on the disapproval train if you want to, but I read 200+ books a year and I frankly don't care if everyone else wants to be in the ""fashionable set"" and disparage this Author. I know tripe when I see it, and E.L. James doesn't write tripe!)
I knew before I bought it that it wasn't going to be another ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", so I wasn't disappointed in that respect. There were very few grammatical errors and the book was well-edited.
That being said, there was a bit too much from both of the main characters being apprehensive about showing their feelings and being too willing to hide major issues from one another. I would have liked more character development, as it seems the only character to turn out as originally described was Caroline, who actually did turn out to be Maxim's best friend. I think Maxim's and Alessia's growth is being left for the next book (if there is one.) And what about Kit? I could tell there is a lot more to explore here. I hope this is continued as a series; it will probably be a whole lot better when we get the entire story.
That being said, I think the Kindle price is too high for what I consider to be a middle-of-the-road book.",5

Initially, his victims were women. Later, his crimes would include couples. Eventually, sexual assault escalated to murder.Dubbed the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker (EAR/ONS), the predator somehow managed to evade police, despite dozens of investigations spanning numerous jurisdictions. His elusive nature, combined with the senseless acts of violence that he committed against so many, prompted true crime writer and journalist Michelle McNamara to study the case years later.The search for the EAR/ONS—whom McNamara named the Golden State Killer—consumed McNamara, who spent countless hours researching possible suspects, theories, and clues. She connected with the case on a visceral level. Fascinated with true crime since she was a teenager, when a neighborhood girl was murdered by an unknown assailant, McNamara dedicated much of her life to researching cold cases. She documented her work on her website, True Crime Diary.Sadly, McNamara passed away while in the process of writing this book, which was later completed by her co-researchers as well as her husband, comedian Patton Oswalt. To this day, the Golden State Killer has never been captured.It feels terribly wrong that McNamara didn’t get the chance to complete the work that she was so dedicated to—finally seeing the Golden State Killer brought to justice. But her work lives on, and the compassion she felt for the many victims is a worthy legacy indeed.I received an advance copy of this book from Edelweiss.",5

You have the internal conversations of each main character, the symbolism of the Overlook Hotel and its dark history, the physical alienation from the rest of the world during a specific season every year. You take the general conflicts that many families deal with, add seclusion, a never ending series of psychologically transcending moments, and you have one intense story.

Too afraid to step outdoors, she watches the world pass by from the windows of her upmarket New York home. Separated from husband Ed and daughter Olivia, she fills her days with booze, pills, online chess and a chat forum for agoraphobics.When the Russells move into an empty house opposite, Anna's interest is piqued. She secretly watches through the zoom lens of her camera. One evening a frantic scream shatters the silence and Anna sees something she wasn't meant to see in the Russell's house... something terrifying, something she's helpless to prevent.Oh my, I really enjoyed this debut psychological thriller from A. J. Finn. It was brimming with suspense and intensity. I didn't know what was real and what was imagined. More importantly, it kept me guessing right until the end. It was one of those books you have to keep reading until you know how it finishes. It was addictive and completely absorbing.Anna's dysfunctional lifestyle was excellently portrayed and although the book had only a handful of characters, each was developed to just the right degree with no unnecessary 'padding'. An abundance of fantastic twists and turns kept me on my toes; ok, so some the reader will figure out but others are cleverly concealed. And that ending, WOW!Anyone reading this book will naturally associate it with Hitchcock's classic 1950's movie Rear Window. James Stewart, recovering from a broken leg, spies on a neighbour through his apartment window and suspects him of murdering his wife. But there the comparison ends.

"4390","Pet Sematary: A Novel","The Cat Came Back: King's Pet Sematary","Jerome E. Murphy","198211598X","R3Q7M22XOCFVWG","1555598973","This novel follows doctor Louis Creed, his wife Rachel, and their two children, who move into an old house in Maine near a haunted patch of ground that feeds on human grief and insanity, which it elicits by resurrecting any dead thing interred in its stony grip. The spirit or spirits of the place have a magnetic draw on the human mind that has led to a long, secret local tradition of this very act--mostly involving children's pets, but once in a while, something human. First the family cat gets run over, and then the family's young son. You see where this is going. When summarized, it's far-out, even laughable stuff.Yet Stephen King was afraid to re-read the finished book, his wife afraid to finish reading it the first time, and both of them afraid to see it published. They considered it too disturbing. I can even feel a faint anxiety as I write my review. That a mere book can have such effect is as disturbing as anything else about it--it seems threatening that mere printed matter should exert such power over our nerves. King latercalled it ""a dirty, nasty book.""He's absolutely right. Besides being utterly merciless towards its characters and its readers, the novel contains ideas so unwholesome, so unnatural, and such a fixation on uncanny evil, that some fundamental part of us rebels. This sets up a psychological paradox, for while our brain wants to reject what has been put before us, it also wants to accept it,due to the novel's beguiling realism (another King trademark). What this means is that a thoughtful reader will end up turning over the novel's proposals in his or her brain, and if left to obsess, could wind up very disturbed indeed. There's a reason this book scared even Stephen King.You don't become the world's bestselling novelist by chance. King fills a niche--and it's not just about horror. There is, after all, no shortage of shlocky horror novels whose plots follow storylines similar to those of King's. So what sets his work apart?For one thing, as with the work of Dickens, God is in the details. King disarms us with evocative details from everyday life long before he asks us to believe the unbelievable. He displays a unique talent in this area, and his skill is absolutely one-in-a-million. You read certain passages and think, ""Yes--it is like that, and no one else has articulated it!""This holds true for his meditations on family life, too. ""He more than half suspected that one of the things which had kept their marriage together... was their respect of the mystery--the half-grasped but never spoken idea that maybe, when you got right down... there was no such thing as marriage, no such thing as union, and that each soul stood alone and ultimately defied rationality... And sometimes (rarely, thank God) you ran into a full-fledged pocket of alien strangeness, something like the clear-air turbulence that that can buffet an airliner for no reason at all... And then you trod lightly, if you valued your marriage and your peace of mind; you tried to remember that anger at such a discovery was the province of fools who really believed it was possible for one mind to know another."" It's also clear that King writes from experience when Louis meditates on the inner life of his children and wonders tenderly, musingly, and ""not for the first time, if childhood was more a period of forgetting than of learning.""His work is designed to convince. Even when Louis realizes that his son has come back from the dead, he finds out in broad daylight, while on the phone with his father-in-law. It's then that he sees the mud tracks on the kitchen floor. The way this is described is utterly convincing, and by the time King's done with us, we're in Louis's shoes and we're all too sure that if this could happen, it would happen exactly the way it does here.Another of King's disarming tactics is the pre-emptive strike. We can't laugh the horror away: his characters have already tried to do it for us. We can't rationalize it away: we watch them attempt and fail. One of King's masterstrokes in Pet Sematary is the choice of a doctor for his protagonist--someone whose clinical sense of science and reason resists every assertion of the supernatural, the uncanny, the improbable. Louis Creed does our doubting and our disbelieving for us. The passage where Louis, finally having come round, matter-of-factly calculates the various possibilities that the return of his young son might entail, as though he were working out an algebraic formula, is a subtle example of King's brand of literary achievement.Nor can we wish away the terror by re-situating ourselves in daylight and in modernized, technological settings. Some of the most harrowing passages of the novel take place in an airport. His characters are at home in pop culture. King also has a great feel for the way that simple phrases (""It's only the loons. The sound carries. It's funny."") or even simple words like resurrection or abomination can take on uncanny meanings under the right circumstances and repeat themselves obsessively in one's mind, with cumulative ominousness. Writers will especially appreciate this effect.Throughout Pet Sematary, but especially in the book's last third, there are passages where the narrative becomes so specific, so coldly vivid in timing and detail, as to approach hallucination. The effect this has is unsettling, to say the least. For my money, the most harrowing passages aren't those involving the resurrections, but those that put us in Louis's shoes as he robs a graveyard and then carries his dead sonthrough the haunted woods at two in the morning. It was these passages that kept me awake much later, because they are the most realistic. ""This place was thick with spirits; it was tenebrous with them,"" Louis finally has to admit to himself. ""The reality of what he was doing--standing out here in the dark calling his dead son--suddenly hit him and set his scalp crawling."" I paraphrase, but you get the idea. There is reality in this book: the reality of marriage; of work; of parenthood; of  extended family relations; of neighborhoods; of death; and of evil. As after a particularly lucid dream, there is a part of us that believes what we have just experienced. It takes a little while to recover.Pet Sematary builds to a tense moment and leaves you there: it wants to stay with you. It could have been a modern literary classic if King didn't give in to his temptation to show us too much, simply because his talent at rendering the unbelievable believably entices him to do so. It should have retained the spare, taut, harrowing quality of the night-in-the-woods sequences, but it loses a little steam when we confront the monster.Stephen King has been embraced as a sort of cultural campfire yarn-spinner in the popular imagination. He's given us Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and the Green Mile, not to mention the campily enjoyable miniseries The Stand and the scare-with-a-wink Creepshow series. What's easy to forget about is the dark bite his actual novels have, and not one of them has more bite than Pet Sematary.",4

"4414","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Woah, a book that's almost entirely filler.","Armando N. Roman","198211598X","R397N7BWNGPMOM","1555601666","Maybe I was just spoiled by reading It and The Shining over the last year, but Pet Sematary didn't do anything for me. I'd read many lists that countdown King's best 10 books, and the one that would always be in the top 5 was Pet Sematary, so I bought it. Halfway through the book, I was getting bored. 4/5 into the book, I'd read maybe 9 pages a day, not having much will to finish it. And now that I finished the book tonight, I can say that this is one of those cases where the movie's better. Ironically, the movie was only made because King demanded that he write the screenplay, and they follow it. Watching the movie is like getting a good summary of the book, because at least 400 pages here are filler. And those people that complained about the acting? Hey, it's not their fault the characters in this book aren't that interesting.But for those who haven't seen the movie, Pet Sematary is about the Creed family: Louis and Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage. They move in to a new home after Louis gets a job as a doctor at the local college, and on his first day, a student is brought in after being hit by a car, and he dies. It's a pretty bad experience, to say the least, but things get worse when the patient warns Louis about something he doesn't understand. The next night, Louis has a dream that the patient takes him to an area beyond a 'barrier' at the pet cemetery (misspelled as Pet Sematary by the children who've brought their pets there over the years), and tells him to not go beyond the barrier no matter what. But we all know how well orders like that go, especially when it's about something so full of mystery. We later learn about what exactly is past the barrier, and the history of the location from Louis' neighbor, Jud Crandall, who has some dark secrets of his own that he wants to share with others.It's hard to give the book much of a summary because most of the action is limited to two major events: going to the area past the Pet Sematary, and a major accident that involves the family about halfway through the book. Oh heck, here come the spoilers, so skip to the next paragraph if you don't want it ruined, eventhough it's pretty obvious from the get-go what'll happen, especially with how much forced foreshadowing King gives us. The area beyond the Pet Sematary is an Indian burial ground, and it turns out that those who are buried there come back to life. But not as they were before they died: they come back a sort of smart stupid, for lack of better term. The family cat, Church, is killed one night, and Jud takes Louis to the burial ground because Ellie, who just started kindergarten, can't quite handle the concept of death, plus she's very attached to Church. Church comes back, but more clumsy and slow than he was before. He smells horrible too, no matter how many times he gets a bath. Later on, Gage is killed when he runs out into the road and is struck by a semi truck. Rachel and Louis of course can't handle this (what parents could?), but Louis goes the extra mile and buries Gage at the Indian burial ground. Jud warned Louis that while most animals buried there came back ok, there was one case where a person was buried there, and nothing good came from it.I'm sure I'll get blasted by King fans who check up on the pages for books they like and make sure no one says anything negative about a book of his that they like (way to abuse the 'helpful' voting system there guys), but again, I didn't get anything out of this book. Louis is a very, very boring character, and we never get much background on him. He's a doctor, when he was younger he'd work with his uncle who was an undertaker, and him and his wife are seemingly constantly 'in the mood' now that they have a new home. Even when the horrible accident happens, there's not much description of what's going on in his mind- just descriptions of how sad he looks and other things going on. I got bored reading the same things over and over again, and was about ready to skip to the next chapter, hoping to get some plot progression or actual character development. The only characters I connected with much were Jud, since King always does a good job of making an interesting older character, and Ellie because of her dreams/premonitions. Louis has got to be the most plain, boring main character I've read about in my life. He's the Nicholas Cage of book protagonists. I never really felt bad for him.And this book is just plain overwritten. There's a description for nearly everything, from a matchbook to a doorbell design, to Louis' medical bag. And if I drank, I could've had a drinking game by having a round every time I read something about how a character peeled their lips back and frowned, or whenever the overused 'the soil of a man's heart is stonier' line was used. Oddly enough, there are a lot of typos in the book too, including some blatantly obvious ones like a comma right after a period...at the end of a sentence like this., I felt like I was reading some bootleg version of the book at one point since they'd keep showing up. Finally, what was with the ending? 'seemed like even Mr. King lost interest by that point and threw something together just to get this over with.I feel a bit bad for giving the book 2 stars, because in the introduction, King talks about how this is the only book of his that scares him, and gives us a good background on the events that inspired the story. It was very touching, and I got much more out of the short intro than I did reading the entire book. You could get away with skipping nearly the entire middle section, and essentially not miss anything. So much of the book is just describing things, and Louis being boring. It's crazy. I've only read about 7 Stephen King books now, but It stands as my favorite by far. I'd place Pet Sematary at the bottom, below Hearts in Atlantis and The Gunslinger, though I liked both of those much more. Read this only if you're interested in seeing what changed in the movie, but just know that things are drawn out big time here. Hopefully I'll have better luck with Cujo.",2

"4455","The Mister","A touching and compassionate love story that's a must-read.","The Guide To Romance Novels","1984898329","R3JWUKG7Z91SL2","1555605322","Reviewed by Sharon Thérèse at KFF

I can’t recommend reading and listening to The Mister at the same time enough. In fact, there was a moment when I had to recharge my earphones and ooh boy, did I miss the sensuously aristocratic voice of narrator Dominic Thorburn. And Jessica O’Hara Baker did a very fine job indeed narrating the female protagonist’s feelings, her cadence and that of others. James has been very adventurous mixing Maxim Trevelyan’s thoughts in first-person and Alessia Demachi’s story in third and I won’t even start on the excellent character development!

The author’s combined two complete opposites from totally different walks of life and not just made it work, she nailed it! Another detail which grabbed my attention was the truncated sentences which for me, made a lot of sense since the young lady who would rock Maxim Trevelyan’s world has a couple of problems understanding our idioms and adages. James’ carefully-worded prose knitted together with an original plot put me at ease, seeing as I had no idea what to expect. I’m a glutton for the Fifty Shades series…but this book, well, apart from having a fairy tale ring to it, I can honestly say is it was beyond my expectations.

Fast-moving if not distressing, the prologue opened up my appetite for more. Then when they meet, I had to smile because the scenario was in effect, unusual. Maxim has it all. Or does he? A constant pleasure-seeker, he’d never had trouble finding female company and despite being sorely tempted to have his way with Alessa, he does have a moral compass. Nonetheless, he can’t take his eyes off this lass with a beguiling talent, and she rather likes what she sees, too.

But there are so many hurdles to overcome in this slow burn romance. Present-day subjects such as social class, wealth versus poverty and the protagonists’ cultural differences were told fittingly. But the illegal goings on…deary me, it’s harsh stuff to stomach. Also, reading about Alessa’s plight broke my heart in two. Talk about flipping the pages isn’t in it! 80% in and all I yearned for was getting to the end just to find out if they’d have their HEA.

On a lighter note, the banter’s fabulous. Of course, being the upper-crust Brit that he is, doesn’t stop Maxim from holding back with a few choice phrases, meaning he spends a good part of his time explaining the definitions to Alessa. It all felt very natural to me. Once I got to know him; his true feelings, I wouldn’t have expected less of him.

A pleasant surprise was the pieces of music chosen to accompany Maxim and Alessia’s journey of love and trust, and an even more gratifying experience was listening to preludes and piano concertos being played in the background while listening. Maxim’s eclectic taste in music comes forth so strongly that it made me want to investigate further. I didn’t have to though. One of the gals at KFF excitedly sent me the Spotify playlist link after copying the URL by hand, knowing I’d love it. Bless her.

Anyone who knows me well is aware that I’m a sucker for contemporary romance and James has delivered. The Mister is a passionate and angsty love story and albeit long, I didn’t want it to finish. Touches of the Brit wit were oh-so-very welcomed and watching her characters’ relationship grow was an utter joy. Her descriptive writing concerning London and its surroundings and the landscape in Cornwall, made me feel like I was there. And now for the finale! Hmm…Erika, could there be more where this came from? I sincerely hope so. Bravo and thank you for giving me hours of enjoyment.",5

I'm trying to be understanding, knowing that the author sadly passed away before the book was finished and someone else had to step in a and finish it. Perhaps Michelle's final work would have been different, but the book was very disjointed and was not in any type of chronological order making it very difficult to follow.

Scaggs","1524798622","R3HKUUQLPCP56Y","1555605936","When I first started hearing about Daisy Jones & The Six, I had absolutely NO interest in reading this book. I am not a fan of Rock N’Roll. I barely listen to music as it is, and when I do, I definitely do not listen to anything in that genre. I convinced myself that this plot would have little to offer me. Nevertheless, after @BookSparks announced this book as their final pick for #WRC2019, I caved and picked Daisy Jones & The Six for my March Book of the Month selection.OH. MY. GOD. I am eating my words because the book was PHENOMENAL! I was devastated when I finished the book because I didn’t want this incredible story to end.The first thing that immediately sucked me into this story was the format of the book. The story is told through a series of oral interviews featuring how Daisy Jones & The Six came to be. We are introduced to Daisy Jones, her best friend Simone, the six members of The Six (Billy, Graham, Karen, Teddy, Eddie, and Pete), and other important characters such as previous managers. While this sounds complicated with the multiple POVs, it’s executed brilliantly because the story feels is reminiscent of watching a documentary.The story is set in the mid sixties – late seventies. Right off the bat, we are introduced to Daisy Jones who is devastatingly beautiful but desperate for love and attention since her wealthy parents are too busy to acknowledge her existence. At the age of 14, Daisy immerses herself into the infamous Rock N’Roll scene of Sunset Strip in L.A. by taking whatever drugs she was given and sleeping with whatever rockstars she hung around with. As she continues this trajectory in her teens, she begins to realize that the men she is surrounding herself with just use her for her natural musical talent then cast her aside as a used rag doll once they’ve had their fill. She decides that she will become a star on her terms, and she’s done being someone’s groupie.I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else’s muse.I am not a muse.I am somebody.End of f*cking story.– Daisy JonesThis story is powerfully feminist. All of the female characters are strong, fierce, and a force to be reckoned with. My personal favorite is Camille. She would do anything for Billy and her family. What I loved most about is that she knows that she married a rockstar and never tries to change the man he is instead she is always there to help build him up no matter. This woman is incredible!The story tackles themes of love, heartbreak, loss, betrayal, friendship, and addiction. I think Taylor Jenkins Reid does a spectacular job of tackling the raw truth of addiction without either downplaying or glamorizing it. She shows just how debilitating this disease is and that it is a constant battle every. single. day.After finishing Daisy Jones & The Six, I am officially a Taylor Jenkins Reid fangirl. The woman is an absolutely brilliant storyteller. There were several times in the book that she 100% had me convinced that this was a real band (and yes, I did google to check!). This is one of those books that I will be recommending (more like shouting) to anyone who will listen to me.",5

The detailed descriptions of Anna’s surroundings made me feel like her home was my home, and I could see why she felt safe there. As a long time Alfred Hitchcock fan I loved all the references to his movies, and also that the plot of this novel was Rear Window-ish.

Unlike Reese Witherspoon, I did NOT read the entire book in one night, but I did stay up quite late the last night reading the final 150 points in one sitting. The book does have an Almost Famous vibe about it, but the book is really its own thing. The narrative is interesting -- alternating across each page between all the different voices of characters in the band. As a result, you don't go super deep into any one character's psyche, but you do get invested in how each character sees the same episodes and storyline. So much of what the book is describing is visual that you almost feel like there should be a fake center with glossy pictures of the Rolling Stones and album covers described, the band members, etc. At the end of the book (not a spoiler really), you get all the lyrics of all the songs on their famous album. It's weird to read the lyrics without having any music or tunes to go with them. In a way that's a testament to the author's work, I wanted to *see* and *hear* this world she creates with her words in the book itself. You can easily see this book becoming a ""mockumentary"" -- a fictional documentary (not a satire). That's the style in which it's written. I'm curious what a true music lover or band member would say about the authenticity of the world she creates. I'm as knowledgeable as one of the fans in the book, so I was just along for the ride. And a fun ride it was with lots of different angles and some really deep moments and wisdom interspersed with rock-n-roll rowdy fluff. There's a meta-feel to the book that makes it more interesting than just another story about a rock band. I enjoyed it enough to pass along to a friend and recommend to another friend.",4

Since my son has now read every single Big Nate book ever published I decided to read Payback Time to see if the humor has stayed fresh.Surprisingly, despite some 25 odd years, Lincoln Pierce continues to find humor in the adventures of the self-obsessed but good natured and likable Nate.  While certainly not for adults, my nine-year old was laughing out loud while reading.If your child already likes the humor of Big Nate they’ll like Payback Time.  Nate continues to experience the stress, joys and perspective of the pre-teen years of many Americans.  If Big Nate hasn’t been to your child’s liking, don’t expect any changes. The same formula persists as in earlier books, to the point where certain cartoons almost seem formulaic.But less important than my opinion is my son’s who simply devoured it.  In a few words, Pierce writes a new book with the same winning formula he has used for several decades.  Recommended for elementary school aged children.",3

It made me want to write this before I received the entire book. It was advertised as “A personal and empowering blueprint—from one of America’s rising Democratic stars—for outsiders who seek to become the ones in charge” which for the part that I read was bs. What I read was simply wisdom. I didn’t see that gender or color or party made this better or worse; it was simply wisdom. The hurdles she shared that she had to get over were not really any different for what I saw growing up. She shared the wisdom that she discovered. The biggest part of the author being black and a female was that other black females will more likely read it. That is good. An even wider readership would be better. A strong, aggressive reader probably doesn’t need any push to read, but others do. I think that this will be a great book to read in its entirety. Maybe the book's ‘feel’ will change as it goes on, but I feel that should be of value as long as it is read analytically and thoughtfully. By the way, I am a 60 year old white guy born in Kansas and living in Georgia that believes that wisdom should be accepted from wherever it comes. Blessing to y'all.",5

Not sure why the movie didn't follow the book more closely because it would have been so much better.  Shelley Duvall couldn't have played Mrs. Torrence from the book and even been right for it.  Let's face it, half way through the movie, I wanted to bash her head in.  Her whining version of the character made me sick to death.  So weak and so lame.  How did they even choose her for that part?  At least the book character had some backbone.  Just so enthralled with the book versus the movie that it was like reading something entirely different and so very much better.

I was definitely not disappointed! I love when people who are famous, super funny, really polished, come off perfectly put together, etc. really show a vulnerable and relate-able side to them. Who knew she had such a tough & heart-wrenching childhood? I'm a firm believer that we all have an incident or season of our life from when we were younger and if we don't properly heal from that time in our lives, we emotionally don't mature past that age until we do. Chelsea walks us through her journey of personal healing to do just that. She had a handful of difficult experiences that impacted the way she perceived and reacted to situations throughout her life as aftermath. She was still funny but raw, personable and I felt for her as she let us into a piece of her life she hasn't before.

I finished this book in a day and highly recommended it to all my friends. Thanks for letting us in Chelsea!",5

"4713","Pet Sematary: A Novel","King's masterpiece -- and one of my favorite books","John Ratliff","198211598X","R1C2OULXGUI0T6","1555670725","I first read this book in 1980, at the recommendation of a coworker.  I'd stayed away from Stephen King ... too popular for my advanced tastes.  Anyway, I decided to take a look at the book about 10 PM (on a work night).  Finished it about 7 AM the next morning.  No book has ever taken over my  imagination like this, before or since.Since then, I've read all of  King's work, and consider him the contemporary Dickens.  But having just  reread the Shining for, perhaps, the fourth time, it remains my favorite,  and a modern masterpiece, in my opinion.But I recognize this is  essentially personal.  I've not identified with any other character is  literature as I do with Jack Torrance.  I'm now more than ten years into  sobriety and recovery, and I've often recommended this book to men that I  sponsor.  The depiction of the alcoholic personality, the combination of  fear and resentment and self-pity, at war with Jack's very real love for  his family and desire for goodness, is expressed in a way that makes it  clear that King is writing of something he knows all too well on a personal  level.  Jack Torrance is one of literature's great tragic figures.  I can  only say, ""There but for the grace of God go I.""[By the way,  this is why I can't abide by Kubrick's interpretation.  There's no tragedy  or complexity in Nickleson's portrayal of Torrance.  Kubrick's detachment  from the human delemma ultimately doesn't work for me.]I do believe that  there is a coherent force/power of evil/darkness in the world, though it is  not as powerful that the force/power of good/light.  But I think one of  King's most basic points (in all his work) is that we ignore the power of  darkness at our own risk, that this is one of the real problems in the  contemporary Age of Therapy.  Central to the Shining is the way the force  of the evil in the Hotel is able to utilize Jack's weaknesses ultimately to  turn him to its purposes--to destroy what he love the most.  I find this  very, very realistic (viewing the supernatural stuff as kind of window  dressing).Having reached out for help in a way that the Torrance  character couldn't, I'm now blessed with a life happier than I could  imagine.  But this book now reminds me of how much Divine Grace is involved  for anyone blessed with the ability to build healthy loving relationships  with those around him/her, especially family members, one day at a time.",5

The instrumented system allowed a real-time three dimensional look at what was happening, live in the air as it was happening.  And when those air crews came back to debrief, the data recorded live was there to show them what went right, and more importantly what went wrong.Cubic went on to develop amazing updates to this first 4 aircraft Yuma system. First to 8 aircraft/4 missile simulation system then to 36 aircraft/50 simulation with added air/ground and ground/air simulation capability.Todays system tracks 72 aircraft and 100 weapons simulations along with a fully integrated battle space environment incorporating real and virtual air and ground threat environments.  And yes, the F-35 plays a role in this environment.What's now called P5-TCTS undergirds not only Top Gun training, but the vaunted Red Flag large scale exercises at Nellis and in Alaska.I was a software developer for this amazing system from 1976 to 2008 and saw, and was part of this system during those years. This past year I sat down and wrote a short history of how ACMR grew along side the incredible advancement of computer technology.

Perhaps my perceptions of the characters were colored by the movie by Kubrick, but I feel the characters are so much better fleshed out.  In particular Halloran and Wendy just seemed way more vibrant especially compared to the movie version.  This is a great effort by Mr. King to do his take on the classic ""haunted mansion"" setting.  It does not dissappoint in any of the phases of execution.  What I love is how Mr. king can use the Hotel to give you a taste of particular times, as it feels it all blends together at the Overlook.  He does a great job handling all the diverse elements to make a pleasing blend.

"4744","The Trial of Lizzie Borden","Well-written piece of true crime!","Sarah Morrison","1501168371","RHB4HZC65HV9J","1555673566","Cara Robertson decides to focus a majority of this Lizzie Borden story on the trial itself. Lizzie Borden is being tried for the murders of her father and stepmother, Andrew and Abby Borden. Trigger warning: graphic details are given of the vicious crime. First of all, Robertson draws such a clear picture of the atmosphere of the courtroom and the interactions between the prosecutor and defense council that you feel like you are experiencing all of it in real time. She utilizes passages from journalists who were present, primarily Elizabeth Jordan (New York World) and Joe Howard (Boston Globe).Second, this trial gained such a following of intrigued spectators. They could not fathom that a woman could commit such a violent crime. The blows that killed Lizzie Borden's father and stepmother were numerous and excessive. Those in the courtroom could not reconcile the image of this hideous crime (the Andrew & Abby's skulls were literally on display) with the gentle image of Lizzie Borden. Also, she was criticized for her demeanor, which seemed unsuitable for a woman, because she didn't show emotion (cry) after the murders and very little in the courtroom. She was simply still and composed and that, to many spectators, meant guilty.Last of all, Robertson did a fantastic job reliving both the case against Lizzie Borden and her defense. Since Lizzie Borden's testimony and the interviews from pharmacists, stating that she tried to buy prussic acid (a poison) just a few days prior to the murder of Andrew & Abby Borden, were not permissible in court, there was not much evidence that Lizzie Borden committed the murders. There were no witnesses and not much if any evidence that tied her to the murders. There was just suspicion and a whole lot of it.Because I didn't know much about Lizzie Borden, the trial was a rollercoaster ride of emotions that all led up to a final climatic verdict. However, the story does not conclude with the verdict, so maybe that is the author's way of saying she too is unsettle by the conclusion. We may never know what truly happened the day that Andrew and Abby Borden were hacked to death, but there will always be theories.",5

Reward money was offered to the public, new documentaries came out, & as an avid true crime reader- I was on the case & sleuthing (with thousands of others) every night! I had just finished this book & shut the cover when breaking news hit that they made an arrest in the case. I legit paused the tv to make sure I was seeing this correctly! Talk about perfect timing... I’ll Be Gone In the Dark dives deep into every little detail on these crimes looking for whatever was needed to solve the the case. They explore the link between the East Area Rapist & Golden State Killer & why people believed (correctly) they were the same person. The investigative work is exhaustive & impressive. The stories told from survivors and victim’s family members are breathtaking. I have NEVER been scared reading a book EVER but during the time this was an unsolved case & some aspects truly made my skin crawl. One chapter in this book made me stop reading and turn a lamp on... not kidding. If you’re looking for a true crime story, or just something scary for October, move this to the top of your list!P.S.

As much as I love the movie, I really liked the elements of the book that Kubrick chose not to use.  I thought the background info on Jack was really great and *loved* that Wendy was made of a little stronger stuff than what we saw in the movie.  And I liked Hallorran's story more in the book as well.One thing I really enjoyed is how King took the old evil house story and elevated it.  The way he told the story was very successful at mixing in the character's thoughts and those coming from the Overlook into the main text.  I wasn't crazy about some of the stuff he did with Danny's thoughts (the spelling stuff seemed a little hokey), but overall it was a smart way to add to the story.Like it always seems with this genre, there was a flaw--the evil is almost always made out to be so powerful and pervasive, yet it is often defeated by rather mundane or convenient circumstances.  It wasn't an unscathed victory though, so I give King credit for that.",5

Fairly new to the psychological thriller genre, I read it in two days with a befitting glass of merlot on hand. I really liked quirky Anna's character from the get go, and felt deeply for this scarred, tortured recluse as the book progressed. I could not for the life of me  figure out who did it and I enjoyed  all the twists and turns. I also enjoyed AJ Finn's snarky first-person writing style, his sense of humor, choice of strong verbs, and the old movie references, many of which I've seen and now want to rewatch. I deducted one star (okay, just a half!) for the overuse of metaphors/similes as others have pointed out, especially since some of them made no visual or logical sense (ie. my robe is smeared across the floor like a skid mark), but they didn't slow down the book or lessen my enjoyment. The upcoming movie version promises to be great, and I'm eager to see who they will cast as Anna. With time, I believe AJ Finn will emerge as one of the best suspense writers around.

This is one of those books I couldn't put down and I was on the edge of my seat through the entire thing wondering what was next for Beatriz.

This story is full of so much drama, danger, and love that it's amazing taking it all in and looking for the next scenario to pop up. Beatriz is an inspiration. Her character is strong, vibrant, and so proud of her heritage. I loved that through the entire book she fought for the country she loved. Even when those priorities and the country changes, she still fights. This book has so much history in it as well. I loved that the author put in different parts from the period and they were so engaging and left you with so much pain in your heart for the souls that were lost. Beatriz has two of the most amazing men in this book that fight for her in a different way. I loved them both. Eduardo is such a good friend and he understands Beatriz in ways that no one else does. His character was suave and courageous and I hated everything he endured. Then Beatriz meets Nick and omg, it was instant love for me. His character is powerful, so full of heart and I wanted them together instantly. But this story isn't one of those where the two loves are instantly together. These two go through so much over the years and in the end no matter what path they take, it's a love that lives on forever. It was breathtaking and beautiful.

I give When We Left Cuba by Chanel Cleeton 4 out of 5 STARS!",5

What I didn't realize was it was a One Direction fanfic. I'm not a One Direction fan, but I knew who they were. So once I realized this, its popularity made sense; every one direction fan girl was there to fantasize about one of the singers. I tried to ignore that aspect, but I couldn't get the image out of my mind, and the writing wasn't great. I felt it was a cheap move by an author to climb on someone else's success. Had it just been a free fanfic story, I'd be more open. But, no, Wattpad helped the story get even more popular, and the author swapped out the names in order to sell this story about two awful people who were created to fulfill some weird fantasy about a boy star. But I tried. Couldn't make it through the sample, and from what I've heard from fans of this, it's toxic and angsty, designed to target twelve-year-old girls.I'm sure the movie will do well, but honestly, *eye roll*.

"4872","First: Sandra Day O'Connor","""Maybe in Error But Never in Doubt""","Found Highways","0399589287","R1NSEQ3EV5D9KN","1556003197","While I was reading this book, I saw that author Evan Thomas mentioned Joan Biskupic's biography of Sandra Day O'Connor (titled Sandra Day O'Connor) as a source (one of many sources) while writing the book. I found a copy of that bio, first published in late 2005, and read both books, comparing as I went along. Both writers make an effort to portray O'Connor as more than a Supreme Court Justice, going into her childhood and career before the Supreme Court. Both authors did interview O'Connor, although Biskupic's interviews were conducted as part of her reporting on the Court, while Thomas interviewed O'Connor after her retirement specifically for the biography. Thomas's biography included some sources that Biskupic didn't have access to such as John O'Connor's (Sandra Day O'Connor's husband) unpublished memoir and his diaries. Thomas also discusses O'Connor's life after her retirement, while Biskupic's book ends just as O'Connor is retiring from the Supreme Court. Thomas interviewed many, nearly all, of O'Connor's law clerks from her Supreme Court years, giving a little extra insight into her day to day activities at the Court.Still, I came away thinking that if you had to choose between the two books, you might do better to read Biskupic's than Thomas's. For instance, Biskupic showed how O'Connor had been political well before her rise through the court system -- she had even lobbied Nixon to nominate a woman to the Supreme Court (she endorsed a colleague, but it's easy to believe she thought she herself might also be a good candidate) and had been active in Republican politics since serving on Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign. Biskupic was also more descriptive about William Rehnquist's views on race, leaving the reader with little doubt that he had racist views, while Evan Thomas glosses over the subject with a footnote mentioning rumors of racist behavior. This was relevant to a book about O'Connor because Rehnquist and O'Connor were very close (even romantically close at one point in their college years) and decided almost identically during O'Connor's first years on the Supreme Court, although as time went on, she broke with the conservative bloc more often. The Bush v Gore decision comes across as a shockingly poor judicial decision in both books.Both books are full of interesting inside the court information as well as fascinating analysis of court cases and how they were decided.",4

Thomas provided a number of insights as well as material not covered in prior books.  This book is well worth the read.

"4888","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","Decent read but did not live up to the hype","Quirky Cat","62678426","RJBSGTZNN7Z82","1556005014","The Woman in the Window is a new thriller out, which subscribers of Book of the Month club already know, as it was one of January’s picks. I know the whole “the woman in [blank]” it starting to feel a bit tired, trust me, I get it. There are plenty of creative naming conventions out there, so why do they keep leaning on this one in particular? (because it sells).I was originally debating about whether or not I wanted to read this novel, and it was the description that actually sold me on it. I absolutely adore the concept of having an entire thriller exist in a small space - in this instance its Anna Fox’s house and its immediate surroundings. It’s not something I’ve really seen implemented before, so it piqued my curiosity.Have you ever read a book that’s being highly praised, and just been completely baffled by why it’s so popular? That was how I felt after having read The Woman in the Window. I keep seeing people call it ‘the book of 2018’ (which is silly to me, as it’s only February), and I just don’t get it. Sure, it was a decent read, but there were some pretty big plot-holes as well. Not to mention it wasn’t terribly kind to those with mental health issues.Anna Fox is an agoraphobic child psychologist - try saying that ten times fast. After an incident (which slowly unveils itself during the course of the novel) Anna finds herself to terrified to leave the safety of her home. One would think a psychologist of her level would have the tools required to help her, but of course the mind isn’t that simple. On the bright side, Anna is actually seeking professional help, but she also breaks a lot of big rules in the world of psychology, and it ended up grating on my nerves.Rule number one; don’t mix medications (anti-anxiety, anti-depressants, sleep aids, etc) with alcohol. Alcohol combined with any one of the medications she’s on would be a recipe for trouble, but drinking (in excess) while on a plethora of medications is just stupid and dangerous. Anna of all people should know better, considering her background. But without the drugs and alcohol combination we don’t get the obscuring of the truth (is Anna hallucinating, or did she really see that?) or the doubt from other characters (whom had reason to be concerned about what she saw, even if they shouldn’t have allowed this concern to affect their judgment or demeanor).Rule number two; don’t practice medicine online, through unofficial means. I know there are doctors (both medical and psychological) that practice online, but guess what; they have to be licensed to do that. From what I can tell, Anna does not. I understand that her heart is in the right place, but she’s opening herself up to some pretty major lawsuits by admitting that she’s a psychologist and giving advice the way she is (including suggesting which medications to be taking). It’s a shame we have to think about it like that, but it’s the world we live in I guess.These two rules are broken constantly throughout the novel, which of course meant it was always bugging me (and breaking my immersion, if I’m being honest). I think I might have been willing to overlook either one of them on their own (it is just a book, after all), but for me the combination signaled that the author was doing it intentionally, which resulted in me suspecting at least part of the impending twist.There are several points from the start of the novel that leave the reader curious, begging for any scrap of detail possible. Throughout the novel these stories are slowly revealed, bit by bit. While some of them were really fascinating and well done, others I felt were not worth the time it took to built them up. One in particular (being vague for the sake of those that haven’t read it, but those that have likely know exactly which one I mean) was particularly frustrating for me, as I felt it broke the promise. It made me feel lied to, as there was really no way for us to see this point forming (other than gut instinct, I suppose). I don’t resent the twist itself, just the way it was handled.As for the major and final reveal, I call bull. There’s no way that particular character (again, being vague on purpose) could have gotten to that point without giving away any signals; especially not to a trained and talented psychologist. Yes, yes I know, lots of drinking and drugs, but come on. The suspension of disbelief that’s being asked is just too much for me. I was just so disappointed in the ending, and ultimately that’s the reason I can’t rate it higher than I have.I would like to point out that while I didn’t love this novel, the writing style itself was actually wonderful. While all of the revelations didn’t pan out (in my opinion), I did greatly enjoy the buildup. I still love the concept of having the whole story take place in one setting; I would love to see more of that. Hopefully the author explores this concept further.",3

Clark","0399589287","R107WO6NRA3WQW","1556005717","I have read many biographies of Supreme Court Justices, but never one so filled with intimate details.  This study was obviously written with the full encouragement and assistance of O'Connor's family.  The notes are full of references to family diaries, memoirs, letters; abundant family photos appear throughout; and many friends and associates willingly were interviewed. Former clerks usually sworn to secrecy are open and detailed in their interviews with the author.  Normally, this would raise questions in my mind as to how impartial the bio was; but I can say that in all its 400 plus pages of text I found only one instance (the chapter on Bush v. Gore) where I felt the author was unduly defensive of his subject. So this is the most complete and candid bio we are likely ever to have on the Justice.There are many additional positive aspects to the book. The reader sees through O'Connor's eyes her colleagues on the Court, with particularly candid views of Alito and Scalia. We get a good close view of how justices interact and form coalitions when voting; how one secures a big court nomination is also examined; the key and vital role of clerks is inspected  with such care as to stand out; and how O'Connor was adept at ""cobbling together"" five votes discloses why and how she became such as influential justice, often favorable compared with Justice Brennan.I was surprised that the author placed only limited reliance on the massive published material about the Justice.  The core of the author's research resides in the more than 350 interviews he conducted. This is what gives the reader such important insights into O'Connor. In fact, especially the clerk interviews allow us to see not just what O'Connor did but why and how she did it. This is not a book that buries the reader in zillions of cases. Rather the author looks at a number of areas (especially affirmative action and abortion) where some important cases were decided, in just enough detail to educate the reader.The most important aspect I took away from the book was O'Connor's philosophical outlook. She advocated ""just do it"" long before Nike.  Her primary motive was pragmatic--cure a problem or resolve a legal issue with a solution that works. Family comes first was a primary directive, as demonstrated when she resigned to take care of her ill husband.  She relied on practical balancing tests (such as her ""undue burden"" standard in abortion cases) rather than black and white rigid criteria. Judicial minimalism was also her goal. So it is no exaggeration to say that if you really want to understand the Justice, as well as be informed about her many accomplishments, this is the book to read.",5

"4911","First: Sandra Day O'Connor","More than a biography","M. L Lamendola","0399589287","R2YG5A33T6D9DO","1556006857","Among the Justices who have served on the Supreme Court since the start of that institution, Sandra Day O'Conner ranks among the very best. This 400+ page biography provides the reader with the story of how she became the outstanding Justice she was. It also provides insight into the workings of the Supreme Court.Sometimes, it comes off as a bit fawning or a bit dismissive of her faults. That is normal in the realm of biographies, especially those that rely upon family cooperation and the cooperation of the subject to get written (as this one did).Hers was a brilliant mind, brought down late in life by Alzheimer's. Her husband John preceded her that way; in fact, his Alzheimer's was the reason she retired. John gave up his career for her to be on the Court, so when he became disabled she felt it was her turn to give up her career for him.I reviewed the advanced uncorrected proofs, but found few errors. Though the cover shows a single author, Evan Thomas, the book was actually written as a  joint project with his wife Osceola. The quality of this text (actually written in Standard Written English, excellent wordsmithing, and good rhythm to the prose) immediately gives the impression he has done this before. At the time of this writing, Thomas has nine books to his credit.From the cover and first inside page, you get the impression this book is about her being first. There's a list: 35 years before Hillary Clinton secured the nomination, 32 years before Sheryl Sandberg leaned in, 16 years before Madeline Albright became Secretary of State, 12 years before Ruth Bader Ginsberg joined her on the bench, and 12 years before Sally Ride went into space. Other firsts are mentioned throughout the book.While this is an important theme in the book, along with the gender discrimination barriers she broke, it's not the central theme. The central theme is how, for quite some time, the Supreme Court was the O'Connor Court. Hers was often the deciding vote, and we see her fine legal mind at work in the reasoning behind her vote in the many examples provided by the author. Unlike the other Justices (generally), she was looking forward to the effect a given decision would have in the future and what its ripple effects and backlash might be. That, by definition, made her both a visionary and a leader.As a leader, she avoided making offensive or belittling remarks about other Justices or their decisions. The great jurist, Justice Scalia, lacked this restraint and that is why (IMO) he was passed over for Chief Justice when Rehnquist retired. She wanted the Court to be respected, and that meant keeping high standards of behavior in communication and decorum.She also had serious concerns about the breakdown in civility in Congress and in our political system generally. Another concern she had was that, in our lay citizenry, the level of ignorance about civics is profound (my words, not hers). Some years ago, a law firm commissioned a study of college seniors and found that only 40% could identify the three branches of government. On a multiple choice question. On and on it goes, and this is a huge problem. Even sitting presidents incorrectly identify our type of government; Teddy Roosevelt managed to replace a bicameral Congress with two popularly elected chambers, and more recently GW Bush repeatedly referred to our government as a democracy. In a civics-savvy country, these things would not happen.Some years ago, I watched a documentary in which Justice O'Connor and Justice Breyer gave a civics class to grade schoolers. She showed them how small our Constitution is (she always carried a copy in her purse, too). And they both explained its basic concepts.Recently, I was involved in a petition drive to stop a particularly egregious act of fraud and corruption on the part of the local government. The First Amendment protects our right to ""petition the government for redress of a grievance"" and yet many people I spoke with did not know this. Most people believe the First Amendment gives you the right to be rude to other people, but they have no idea it protects your right to speak out to the government. It's these kinds of things that Judge O'Connor saw long before being nominated to the Supreme Court.I don't know if it's an unintended or intended consequence, but Evan and Osceola Thomas have paid the ultimate tribute to Justice O'Connor by showing, in a very interesting and engaging way, a few things about how the government works. For that, I am sure her family and friends are grateful.This book consists of 16 chapters, and runs just over 400 pages (including photos). The narrative follows pretty much in chronological order. The book is exhaustively researched, as both the Notes and Bibliography show. But it's one thing to read a written source and take notes from it (that was one way this book was researched) and quite another to spend hours interviewing a person (and then another and then another) from one to a dozen times to get information. All the collating, cross-checking, and sifting of this information was no minor chore. I really appreciate what the authors have done.This book makes an excellent addition to anyone's personal library.",5

"4914","First: Sandra Day O'Connor","a valuable history of a historic Supreme Court Justice","Robert D. Harmon","0399589287","R1THJV2XPVACVS","1556007157","An inspiring, and well-researched, biography of the nation's first woman on the U.S. Supreme Court. The author may be among the last to interview the former Justice (now in assisted living), and had numerous interviews with her former law clerks, colleagues (including other Justices), and family friends. He had rare access to her private papers and seems to have done formidible reasearch at the Library of Congress and at the Court.He follows her life from her early days on a ranch on the Arizona-New Mexico border to her school days. She goes on to six years in combined undergraduate and law studies at Stanford, where she was classmates with, and briefly dated, the future Chief Justice William Rehnquist. We learn of her graduation with honors and, as a woman, being offered nothing at law firms but secretarial work. Even a dozen years after graduation, after she had married John O'Connor and moved to Phoenix, she was unable to join a law firm. Her husband was a partner in a top law firm while she had to hang out her shingle in a Phoenix strip mall. Nonetheless, she and her husband would raise a family and rise in Phoenix society and Republican politics, and she would get an appointment to the state senate -- a rough legislature and rude male colleagues, we're told -- and eventually to a position as a state court judge.We find how the times had changed so that, when Ronald Reagan became president, he would want a female Supreme Court appointment, and how O'Connor, then a state appellate judge, would be chosen. Most of the book, therefore, is of her time on the Court from 1981-2006. The book tells us much about the Court's work in those years, its internal dynamics and O'Connor's role, more and more, as a swing vote. As a legal history of the Court in those times, the book is valuable. It was a period of major, sometimes harshly controversial, rulings on everything from abortion to the Bush v. Gore election of 2000. As someone who has studied, and followed, constitutional law, I can say that it's a well-told and detailed look at the Court in those times, and of the bigger-than-life personalities that served alongside her: Brennan, Rehnquist, Scalia, Thurgood Marshall, and the rest.We get a sensitive discussion of her tragedies as well: her husband's creeping dementia, the creeping infirmities of her own aging, the decision of when, and how well-timed, was to be her retirement. That she was balancing all this, during her final years, with contentious and momentous caseloads says much. Highly recommend, not just to legal scholars but to anyone interested in this country's social history in the last quarter of the 20th Century. Highest recommendation.",5

I do feel like Rootpaw and Bristlepaw are kind of boring and cutouts of previous characters, their stories are not new or engaging to me. Rootpaw at least seems to have a interesting future that was suggested by the ending but I don't know what Bristlepaw was put into the book besides being a perspective in Thunderclan. I also don't like how the previous arcs characters are barley mentioned in this book, Violetshine gets a few lines and Twigbranch only gets one...we don't hear from Finleap at all. We deal with Starclan a lot in this book and every cat is talking about how skeptical they are of Shadowpaw yet Thunderclan has had so many cats linked to Starclan in the past and Jayfeather's powers or any of the other cats powers or past are not even mentioned...it bothers me.

I really hate how they killed LP and SF before we even got to read it in SF Hope. These were supposed to be really impactful to the readers and I think it being spoiled in this book is unfair to long time fans. They didn't kill Firestar or anyone else in a Super Edition so the fact that they did it here is sad. None the less I enjoyed this book and like Shadowpaw and his story line, Rootpaw shows promise but Bristlepaw needs to grow wings or something because she is just another Mary Sue.

I am reserving my opinion of the new writing team for later in the series. I wasn't too happy with how the last arc ended and am feeling like this one might be similar...it will start out bright but then fizzle by the fourth book.",4

"4927","First: Sandra Day O'Connor","""IT'S GOOD TO BE FIRST.  BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LAST.""","David Keymer","0399589287","R3PNPWDR6EG2ST","1556008117","“It’s good to be first. But you don’t want to be last.”This is an exceptional, because both perceptive and sympathetic, biography of our country’s first woman Supreme Court justice, Sandra Day O’Connor, a woman who by any standard was highly superior. (Think of her as president instead of George W, Bush, for instance.) Early in  her life, she realized the bar was different for men and for women: “If you were smart, the boys didn’t like you. Being self-assured and smart were turnoffs to the men. They were the ones who were permitted to be smart and self-assured. You wanted to keep it under wraps.” That was a judgment confirmed when graduating from Stanford Law near the top of her class, she couldn’t land a job as a lawyer, ,instead (famously, later on) being asked if she could type  well enough to be hired as a legal secretary. She found other ways to advance and eventually ended up on Reagan’s short list for the Supreme Court: he had promised to install a woman. (When John and Sandra had visited the Supreme Court early in their marriage, John had  said:  “This is [the] first and the last time we’ll ever see this place.”Throughout her long, exceptional reign as the deciding vote on the sharply divided Court, O’Connor showed over and again her strengths as jurist and mediator and her basic concerns. She wanted change, never wanted to retreat, but was never, never, a radical. (One time she told a US senator, who was wobbling on an issue: “ You know, the only thing you get from sitting on the fence is a sore crotch.”A good deal of this book is about Supreme Court relations (how she interacted with Brenan, Stevens, Scalia, Ginsburg).  A great deal more is about what Justice O’Connor was made of herself as a person: an achiever but not a radical, looking for solutions that the majority of the American public wouldn’t run away from because too radical, “rarely relaxed, but …  almost always calm.”  “She didn’t expect special treatment for women. She just didn’t want them to be prevented from doing certain things.”The big issue during her twenty-eight ears on the Court was abortion. Roe v. Wade in one form or another, coming back over and again. And then at the end, there  was Bush v. Gore. With someone like O’Connor, you can’t pen a single judgment, good or bad. There’s no question that in balance she did good. But she lived in a complicated, partisan world and not everything she did stands up to judgment. She seems to have stood with Justice  Learned Hand, when he wrote: “The spirit of liberty is the sprit which is not too sure it is right.” She never exhibited an excess of  hubris, and that by itself is an anomaly in the hyper-power world of Washington politics.There’s more in this book: the love story of as husband who supported his wife at his own professional advancement; the story of a family that worked and a mother-wife who seemed able to do everything at once; the sad tale of Sandra’s husband, John’s decline into Alzheimer’s and then after Sandra’s resignation from the bench, her own bout with the same disease.I come from the opposite side of the bench on party issues but it is hard not to admire a woman, a super-competent human being, would say to a president post 9/11, “A state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the nation’s citizens.”Let’s face it, she was a mensch.",5

Justice O’Connor seems like a woman who had it all, the pinnacle of what the women’s movement strives for BUT – she managed to maintain her identity of wife, mother, social hostess.  Layered on top of that was her identity as lawyer, politician and legislator.  Carrying all this burden on her back she was able to shape the face of America while finding her way through the old boys club of the Supreme Court.Mrs. O’Connor was a handbag carrying Republic woman who was very traditional and conservative in her outlook and opinions.  The book shows how her appointment to the Court led some to view her negatively for being too traditional.  Over the years, though, she morphed and her voting record became more liberal.  Her votes became more protective of minorities, women, and some being held in military prisons without charge or trial for terrorist activities.Family continued to come first for Justice O’Connor and she proved this with her retirement.  She retired in 2005 to care for her ailing husband, John, who was suffering from Alzheimer's.  This is an interesting, informative, and entertaining book that is well researched and factual.  I’ve never supported Justice O’Connor in all of her decisions, especially early in her career but I’ve always admired her.",5

Even Thomas is a gifted writer, taking what could have easily been a dry and factual look at the life of Sandra Day O'Connor and turning it into an absorbing, entertaining read. Beginning with O'Connor's early years in Arizona, Thomas portrays the future trailblazer as a smart, hard working woman who was able to rise above the challenges of being raised on a cattle ranch. Like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, O'Connor attended and graduated from law school at a time when opportunities in law for women were virtually non-existent. Yet O'Connor was able to quietly forge a path that led to her appointment as the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Thomas, himself a law school graduate, is especially adept at shaping O'Connor's legal career and decisions into an informative and immensely enjoyable book. Thomas did his homework when it comes to interviewing those closest to O'Connor over the years and the result is not only a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the life of O'Connor but also the Supreme Court itself.",5

"4946","First: Sandra Day O'Connor","A Compassionate Portrait of The First Female Justice","Michael Griswold","0399589287","R11B1DJZN892DN","1556009737","I picked this up because of Evan Thomas previous very thorough work on Richard Nixon and other figures. In the 400 or so pages of First, certain themes are hit on such as her ranch upbringing that taught her a certain hard work and self-reliance that would lead her to Stanford, the legislature, and eventually the Supreme Court. Or her time in the Arizona state legislature which taught her how to be pragmatic and move gradually towards practical solutions, which is why her opinions on the Court where often measured rather than the broad sweeping dictates that partisans on the right and left would’ve wanted. But there was another side to Sandra Day O’Conner that Thomas captures beautifully.Yes, she could be tough and pragmatic, but she was also very compassionate and showed reverence and respect to her clerks and cordiality to other justices (even if she didn’t agree with their personal views.) She always stressed the importance of family and attempted to impart them with a wide range of experience. In addition to learning about Justice O’Conner as a person we also get a healthy lesson in court dynamics between the liberal and conservative wings of the court that she had to balance and how she felt about some noted judges personally.A very warm and thorough portrait of an important figure.",4

High","62664484","R3GD6WRO6VE8P4","1556009797","Normally starting a trilogy by reading the last book first is recognized as a poor strategy.  It certainly was for me in this case.  I've always wanted to read ""The Cartel"" and ""Power Of The Dog"" but current releases by favorite authors have kept these two tomes on my bedside table.  Unfortunately I have found my time in retirement to be just as busy as when I was working.  I would like nothing better than to spend 3-4 hours a day reading but somehow my ""honey do"" list keeps growing as well as my fatigue level.  Reading an hour or so at bedtime only lasts about five minutes so I feel lucky when I can set aside an hour to read each day.Having read a few of Don Winslow's earlier works and seeing how well he sets the stage for his stories, I felt secure that he would provide enough backstory in ""The Border"" to overcome the additional knowledge I would have gained by perusing the first two books in the trilogy first.  Unfortunately, no matter how hard I tried, even by referring to prior pages to cross check and reinforce my understanding, I still found myself confused by the plethora of key characters, their development from teenagers to mature adults, their familial connections, and the constantly shifting loyalties and allegiance.  In addition the reader has to keep track of how the old criminal organizations morphed into new entities, who supplied which drugs in the pipelines, the constantly changing alliances in the distribution network, the old debts and vendettas still motivating two generations of drug traffickers, and so on.Mr. Winslow tried to explain it all and I attempted (very strongly) to understand and retain all of the details he puts forth, but my older brain just couldn't keep it all straight.  That shouldn't be a surprise though considering that the prior two novels in this series totalled about 1,200 pages of information.  The author is known for his attention to detail (without being overwhelming), his powerful dialogue, and the complicated web he weaves, so it's no wonder that his references in ""The Border"" weren't enough to overcome all the detail presented in the prior two books.  My suggestion to you would be to read ""The Cartel"" and ""The Power Of The Dog"" first and in order.  Otherwise you will miss the full impact of what Mr. Winslow has to say and how this criminal industry has totally evolved over two generations.This novel as presented by the author is a real hard take on drug trafficking in Mexico and America.  Needless to say, it's all about the money, and any vacancy in the distribution network is rapidly filled by someone else who seizes upon his/her opportunity to secure the prize.  Drug interdiction has changed according to its needs and much analysis has been put into how to 'kill the snake' instead of just 'cutting its head off'.  As others have mentioned, Don Winslow has used his voice to criticize and condemn those who hold opinions different from his.  While I can't tell who is right and who is wrong, Mr. Winslow has the right to his opinion just like everyone else.",5

At a time when women were expected to be homemakers, she set her sights on Stanford University. She graduated near the top of her law school class in 1952, but no firm would even interview her. Sandra Day O’Connor’s story is that of a woman who repeatedly shattered glass ceilings—with a blend of grace, wisdom, humor, understatement, and toughness.She became the first ever female majority leader of a state senate. As a judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals, she stood up to corrupt lawyers and humanized the law. When she arrived at the United States Supreme Court, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, she began a quarter-century tenure on the Court, hearing cases that ultimately shaped American law. Diagnosed with cancer at fifty-eight, and caring for a husband with Alzheimer’s, O’Connor endured every difficulty with grit and poise.REVIEWAbsolutely loved this authoritative and well-sourced autobiography of Sandra Day O’Connor, who became the most powerful woman in America.  Sources include Supreme Court internal records, and interviews with O’Connor, and many of her clerks, friends and family.  FIRST draws a fabulous portrait of her childhood, her personal life, and her twenty-five years on the bench.The writing is superb. I cried when I read the explanation of her appointment to the Supreme Court, just as I had when she was actually appointed in 1981. I loved hearing about her thoughtful deliberations on the tough issues of discrimination and abortion. I laughed at the many funny stories of dancing, making jokes and having a good time.  I enjoyed reading about her jovial husband John, and how he dealt with being married to the “most powerful woman” in America.  I was captivated at many details of her relationships and interactions with the other justices.Being from Florida, one of my favorite parts of the book was the chapter on Bush v. Gore.  Not because I necessarily liked the outcome, but because I now finally understand the rationale behind it. FIRST is an inspiring and enlightening autobiography of an amazing woman. The book is smartly structured and is bounding with magnificent personal and professional details. Highly recommended.Author Evan Thomas is the author of nine books including two NYT best sellers: John Paul Jones and Sea of Thunder. Thomas was a writer, correspondent, and editor for thirty-three years at Time and Newsweek, including ten years (1986–96) as Washington bureau chief at Newsweek, where, at the time of his retirement in 2010, he was editor at large.Thanks to Netgalley, Evan Thomas and Random House for an advance reading copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Publisher  Random HousePublished  March 19, 2019",5

Once you get your hands on the cookbook, you'll have countless reasons to celebrate, whether it's a birthday, graduation or lazy Saturday. Recipes require minimal ingredients and can easily be halved or doubled (for a small party or crowd) and customized to your liking. In fact, one of my favorite features of the book is the ""Flavor Chart"" – a guide for mixing and matching cakes and toppings. It highlights just some of the many possibilities: chocolatey chocolate cake with silky marshmallow icing, lovely lemon yogurt cake with citrus syrup, madeleines with crème anglaise … the list goes on. On top of that, Odette offers variations for each creation.Inviting photography brings the narrative and recipes to life and compels you to get in the kitchen and bake. I've already tackled Odette's chocolate-orange olive oil cake and it was a huge success – light, moist and perfectly sweet.I'm eager to continue working my way through the rest of the Simple Cake recipes.

"4981","First: Sandra Day O'Connor","Great insight into Sandra Day O’Connor","Deb","0399589287","R2LHLC736029R4","1556012437","The book shares insight into O’Connor’s childhood, education, family, and career.  It also addressed the challenges Sandra faced after graduating from law school.  Sandra had to leave Lazy B when she was six to live with her maternal grandparents and go to school.  The Lazy B roots will influence much of O’Connor’s life.  Her children and family were always top priority to Sandra.  The O’Connors had three sons and Sandra was able to successfully blend motherhood and a career.  She was a strong-willed, intelligent, and humble woman.“John O’Connor was not threatened by her “intellectual power” and very supportive of Sandra.  John and Sandra had a good time together dancing, joking.  “O’Connor loved amateur theatricals, both watching them and putting on her own skits with John.”  In this book, I felt a clear understanding of John and Sandra’s relationship.  The book touches on the impact to John when Sandra was appointed to the Supreme Court.  He gave up his influential position in Phoenix and found a position in Washington.  “The O’Connors’ closest friends saw the effort that John put into his role as husband of the Most Powerful Woman in America.”She was the “first” at many things including “…the first female majority leader of a state senate in Arizona and U.S. Supreme Court.”  Sandra mentored her clerks and was involved in their personal lives.  She would walk away from fights she deemed unnecessary, while never shying away from the important ones.  She knew when to tease, when to flatter, and when to punch…”“O’Connor was the most powerful Supreme Court justice of her time.”  For most of her 24+ years on the Court, she was the controlling vote on many of the great societal issues.  Sandra had a close relationship with her law clerks.  The clerks understood that they were undergoing more than legal training in her chambers.”  The book frequently touched on an exercise class Sandra started for the interns (and anyone else who wanted) and herself to participate before the workday.Once confirmed, “The justices, she was surprised to discover, rarely spoke to one another; they preferred to communicate by memo.”  “,,,justices rarely spoke to each other outside of conference. Their chambers were “nine separate one-man law firms,” as one justice put it.  With few exceptions, they did not visit each other or pick up the phone.  Sandra was instrumental in changing this.  Justice O’Connor “was more in sync with the public mood than her fellow justices.”A great deal of the book addresses major cases before the Supreme Court and Sandra’s stand on the cases, including abortion, elections (Bush v. Gore), women’s rights.  Often she was the “fifth vote.”  Her childhood and background greatly influenced her decisions Book rolled right along but bogged down in the details of legal cases which may lose some readers.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg joining the court is touched upon.  “The two women were not natural pals… but … When Ginsburg was diagnosed with cancer in 1999, O’Connor was able to guide her through…” O’Connor’s influence on Ginsburg is discussed.  The relationships and approaches with the other justices was shared.  Sandra.  “made it her business to get along with every justice…”  “The reason this place was civil was Sandra Day O’Connor.”  “The plight of women and children reached a deep place in O’Connor.  So, too, the plight of minorities.  But she continued to see no easy answer for the legacy of racism in society.  Race, or rather racial preference, continued…”Health issues were raised up:  Sandra battled breast cancer.  She fought this battle while on the Court and “returned to the Supreme Court … ten days after surgery.”  During this time, the book shared her emotional turmoil but “hardly a pause in the O’Connors’ social calendar.”  Sandra “…did not speak publicly about her cancer for six years.”  John was later diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and in true Sandra form she took care of her husband much longer than most.  She was very reluctant to have him in a facility.She stepped down from the Supreme Court because “John needs me.”  True to form, she chose her family over her career.  She was actually modeling a balanced life…  Make time for your family.  Take care of yourself.”  “Never complain, never explain,“ might be her motto.The book ends indicating Sandra is now battling Alzheimer’s disease.  I found this to be a well written book and very insightful of Sandra Day O’Connor.  A lady I admire.",4

The author's writing style makes this an interesting read. It covers the life of the first woman to be appointed to the Supreme Court. The book does an excellent job of describing how O'Connor arrived at the opinions that she wrote and how she dealt with differing opinions within the court itself including some attacks that were more personal versus objective. Justice O'Connor was a trail blazer in many ways and it is unfortunate that the current make-up of the court has become increasingly political and positioned to undo much of the work that she did.I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the first woman to be appointed to the Supreme Court or the more recent history of the court.I received a free Kindle copy of First: Sandra Day O'Connor by Evan Thomas courtesy of Net Galley  and Random House, the publisher. It was with the understanding that I would post a review on Net Galley, Goodreads, Amazon and my fiction book review blog.

I thought the first 100 pages, which details her life before her appointment to the US Supreme Court, were a little too detailed. That is my personal preference. Once she was appointed, many of the chapters dealt with key areas of law like affirmative action, campaign finance and abortion, and how her vote on the Court either evolved or changed over her 25 year tenure and why.He used her opinions and writings as primary source material. The author used much anecdotal evidence though to support his telling.  Much of the book was based on secondary sources including interviewing her sons, interviewing former law clerks and friends, and quoting from her late husband's personal journal. The author had tremendous access to these sources and the telling of SOC's life showed it. Sandra Day O'Connor lived a nuanced life. Her Court opinions reflected that, and that is the most fascinating eye opener of this book!Worth the read!",4

She was the first and wanted others to follow.  She is a strong believer in societal issues on abortion, affirmative action and religious freedom. She loves the rule of law.Sandra Day O’Connor has several firsts in her long career. One of the first women to attend law school, first woman leader of the Arizona Senate, and, of course, the first female Judge in the Supreme Court. Born in Texas, she was brought up on a cattle ranch in Arizona. This ranch is one of her loves.  She went to college and Law School at Stanford. Upon graduation she had some difficulty finding a job because was a woman. She did some clerk work.  She married and went to Germany with her husband while he was in the military. Always a woman of active service, while raising three boys she was active in various political organizations and was appointed Senator from Arizona. From then on, nothing held Sandra Day O’Connor back.With the spotlight always on her, she held her own as a Supreme Court Judge.. Several memorial cases were written by her, and she was a firm feminist. Billed as a Republican, she was a staunch Planned Parenthood defender. I do remember hearing an interview on NPR with Terry Gross. She gives no prisoners, and she was short with her answers. It may have been a long day, but she did not come across as well as she could have. I learned from reading this book that she was a lovely, caring, woman who spoke her mind. She gave up her role as a Supreme CourtJudge to care for her husband who had Alzheimer’s. And,  following her husband’s disease, she announced in October of 2018, that she was giving up her public appearances because, she, too, has Alzheimer’s. This vibrant woman who has been a role model for many woman is going through her own traumas. “NeverComplain, Never Explain”, may have been her mantra. One of the good ones will not be forgotten.Recommended. prisrob 01-08-19",5

"5030","First: Sandra Day O'Connor","A Remarkable Life","Dave Wilde","0399589287","R2LPKTME14SMR4","1556017957","“First” is a in-depth biography of one of the most remarkable women in American history.  In many ways, Justice O’Connor has not received the recognition she deserves for being such a groundbreaking figure.  Based on over a hundred interviews with friends, family members, fellow justices, and almost all of her law clerks, First offers a wide sweeping portrait of O’Connor from her beginnings on a dusty Arizona ranch hours from the nearest city to her final years when she left the Court to care for her husband as he suffered from late-stage Alzheimer’s.The first part of the book traces her early years in the Day Ranch as O’Connor grew up and formed her values.  The story follows her to Stanford where she met and dated future Supreme Court Chief Justice Rehnquist.  But, even graduating from a top university with stellar grades only garnered her job offers as a legal secretary, not as a lawyer.  Their loss!O’Connor worked her way from the bottom to become the Majority Leader of the Arizona Senate and then a judicial appointment to state court.  Her struggles and success in the Arizona Legislature are detailed here but are not as compelling as the rest of her story.The story then turns to what made her famous: her appointment to the Supreme Court by President Reagan.  Like the Brethren, Evans details for us the inner workings of the High Court, but with O’Connor as the center hub of the story, not Brennan.  Evans both humanizes O’Connor and her fellow justices.  Major court decisions are discussed as are the inner court debates on how to decide the cases.  The discussion is at a level which is complex enough to appeal to a legal audience and to lay readers as well (I think).This biography is well-researched, well-detailed, and leaves one with an appreciation for what a remarkable person Justice O’Connor was and what a remarkable life she led.Many thanks to the publisher for providing a copy for review.",5

Her decisions really tried to consider the impact of how this would impact someone in real life.

Overall I looked the book, it has great photography and the recipes are well written with a few small problems that wont affect the outcome. (For a good review of these problems read the lengthy review by BirdNest. I would add that some of the recipes that were not marked as gluten free could have easily been made gluten free with a small change.

Ordinarily, I would would overlook the small errors as the don’t really affect the outcome of the recipes and give this book a five star rating. But this book represents itself as a healthy cookbook. They break the recipes down into categories like Vegan, Gluten Free, Paleo, Vegetarian... but they don’t give caloric or nutritional information for the recipes. This to me is a glaring error.

If you’re concerned about your nutritional health or weight loss I cannot recommend this book due to its lack of nutrition information. If you’re looking for a cookbook with overall healthy recipes this is a good cookbook to add to you collection.",4

O'Connor","1400069998","R35JS48Y8COIMO","1556029433","I felt like Christmas came early when I was approved for an ARC of Save Me The Plums. I really did! I have been a huge fan of Ruth Reichl since I read the first book she wrote.

I had no idea she was writing another one, but wow, what a book this was! It covers her being hired on at Gourmet and the eventual closing of that magazine. The world lost a great magazine when Gourmet closed and in reading Ms. Reichl's memoir, I felt everyone's pain as if I were a Gourmet writer or staffer.

Ms. Reichl has a wonderful talent in describing meals, people, her environment and pretty much anything so that the reader feels they are there. While many of the decadent meals she described had many foods I wouldn't eat, I still felt as if I were there, enjoying the conversation, the wines and the meals.

Not only will someone reading this get to experience world class meals, but they'll experience the running of a magazine, the work that goes into it and the juggling act we all struggle with, life/work balance.

I cannot recommend this book strongly enough, especially if you're a fan of the author, of cooking and/or celebrity chefs. This book has it all.

Thank you goes to the author, the publisher and Netgalley for my ARC. My thoughts and review are my own.",5

I wanted to read, it was there, it needed to be read.  But I'd heard horrors about Anthony Hopkins and that hotel in Colorado and.. I wanted to be able to sleep.  So I told myself - I'll read 'til it gets scary.150 pages later, I thought.. huh, this isn't that bad. I'll keep reading...Then my mind began to process everything coming through it and OH MY GOSH I COULD NOT CLOSE MY EYES.I fully expected lots of gore, lots of slashing madness, but what I didn't expect was the psychological impact something like a shaking elevator, or locking someone in a walk-in fridge would do to me.

"5172","The Making of a Manager: What to Do When…","An actually-useful book for first-time managers (and beyond)!","Wayne","0735219567","RJKNGPJA964GL","1556034313","This is hands-down the book I wished I'd had when I began managing 8 years ago.  It definitely would have saved me from making countless & costly  mistakes during my first few years of management, and I will benefit from it greatly as a manager even now!What sets this book apart from other books about management is unlike other management books written by folks at the end of their careers, Julie still remembers her own ramp-up into management (due to her meteoric rise from intern to VP at Facebook in less than a decade).  Julie's complete honesty about all her fears, insecurities, and mistakes at the time (and how she continued to experience them throughout her career) makes her the reader's relatable management confidant and her lessons far more potent.Julie is a masterful storyteller and effective teacher, seamlessly weaving together her own management war stories to illustrate core principles, combined with practical & easy-to-remember frameworks for managers to use.  Each chapter opens with a cute illustration cementing a key idea from the management topic to be discussed.  While most of the book focuses on topics that will help first-time managers, later chapters touch upon topics that will help even seasoned managers, such as hiring and managing managers yourself and setting the culture of your organization.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about making the plunge into management, in their first few years of management, or even to experienced managers looking for a refreshing take on management.  This is a new gold standard for books on management.",5

That is exactly what Unplanned did for the abortion industry.  It took all the dirty secrets--that I'm aware of and more--and put them out on the screen for everyone to see.  I wish to thank all those that probably risked their careers or maybe even lives for making this movie.It is Saturday evening as I write this review so I'm putting it out there for all those that already watched it and those who are going to see the movie tomorrow to do what I did today--go see it twice.If anyone has just 1 oz of pro-life agenda in their blood they need to go see Unplanned this weekend and support this movie.  With that said be advised this is not a movie for anybody under the age of 15 or maybe even  older depending on how emotionally developed said child is.  Without giving away the details there is blood but no more than you would see in a movie with an R rating.I pray that this will force laws to change making it unlawful for a teen to have an abortion without parental approval.

Do I praise it for being a masterful achievement in the writing of pure horror, or do I say how it left me feeling depressed and a bit sick? The characters are so well developed, described, and depicted, that the horrors that are unleashed upon them in the second half of the book left me with a feeling of unspeakable dread.Yes, it is scary. No question about it, and I decided in the end my feelings only reinforced my appreciation for Stephen King as an author, after all, he made the characters so realistic and human - read flawed - that they became like friends. Friends that have just about the worst luck in the world.But enough about my own personal reservations about the novel. Stephen King is famous because he has a deep understanding of human nature and, more importantly for a horror writer, human fears. This is a very human novel, despite the title referring to animals (By the way, in case you're wondering, it's spelled ""PET SEMATARY"" instead of ""PET CEMETARY"" because the cemetary was founded by a group of young children with poor spelling).The story concerns the Creeds, a family of four, moving into a small town with a dark secret. Dr. Louis Creed, the father of the family, gets a job as a doctor of medicine at the local college, where he recieves a grim message from a dying patient. This event signals the beginning of a gruesome chain of seemingly unrelated accidents which point straight to a certain cemetary. Not the Pet Sematary of the title, but a much more frightening annex with unspeakably evil power.I cannot remember a King novel as shattering or as disturbing as Pet Sematary. The Shining, which in my own humble opinion is King's best work, was definitely frightening, but came to a relatively tidy conclusion. Pet Sematary ends on the kind of bizarre, twisted ""happy"" ending which is similar to a doctor saying that you'll be doing just fine after they amputate your arms and legs. The conclusion is nasty, unexpected, and a little unsatisfying.But once again, these are minor quibbles for such a great, solid novel. If you have read a few King novels already and enjoyed them, I recommend you pick up a copy of this fright fest today!",4

This book starts with the bold statement that ""Great managers are made, not born"" and proceeds to outline in clear detail what sets apart effective leaders from mediocre managers. While much of the advice seems like common sense (e.g. ""meetings should be useful""), what Zhuo does uniquely well is illuminate what this all means in practice, with specific examples drawn from her own experience, and exercises you can immediately apply to your own teams.

Definitely right up there with The Green Mile and Misery. What makes it so wonderful is that it has real depth. Don't let the ghosts fool you - this is a story about the hereditary evils of alcoholism and abuse.One thing that came to me when rereading this novel for the first time in YEARS was that I felt I couldn't trust the narrator. Not King - he is technically the storyteller - but I noticed that almost all of the pertinent flashbacks are told from the viewpoint of Jack...and he isn't completely honest with us. Several times he clearly lies to us in his flashbacks. For instance, he adamantly professes to NOT having fixed the debate that so enraged his student, but then a few pages later absently admits to fixing it.So how much more of Jack's story can we trust? I'd argue, not much. I think his abuse of Wendy and Danny was far more pervasive than he claims, I think his hit and run DID involve a fatality, and I believe he intentionally, self-destructively egged his student into a fight. One of the biggest complaints against Kubrick's film is that Jack is insane from the start, but he seemed that way in the book as well. Take into account that his flashbacks may not be completely truthful, and I feel we are dealing with a character who was on the verge of a violent mental breakdown before ever stepping foot in the hotel. And isn't that the ENTIRE point? Ghosts didn't make Jack a monster - he already was one. Don't let the ghosts fool you.",5
"5256","BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts","Excellent recipes celebrating American baking","Daniotra","0393239861","R4T5OJJ09790R","1556086531","I've been following Stella for a few months and baking a few of her recipes that she's posted online at serious eats and her blog. And they are consistently excellent. I mean, restaurant quality, at home. I've produced cakes and pies and other baked goods that are as good as anything I've had from a high-end bakery. Guests are amazed, and frankly, I'm amazed (""I made that!"").

I was very excited for this book, and it doesn't disappoint. It's equal parts history and cooking. The historical interludes that introduce each recipe are well-researched, complete with end notes citing to extensive sources. I've never read a cookbook that had a bibliography like this. For example, learning why a graham cracker is called a graham cracker (and why it could be considered a total diss on its namesake, Sylvester Graham), and then baking some delicious and far-better-than-retail graham crackers at home is just great fun. Even better, each recipe has a number of easy variations. Many, if not most, of the recipes also have gluten free versions.

Stella deserves a lot of credit, I think, for going the route of celebrating our national heritage of uniquely American deserts and giving them the treatment that they deserve. Kudos. This will be my go-to baking book for the foreseeable future, and it should be yours too.",5

Graphic and children's reviews on the blog typically feature two or three images from the book's interior, which are not reproduced here.Note that I don't really do stars.  To me a book is either worth reading or it isn't.  I can't rate it three-fifths worth reading!  The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited.  So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).I rated this book WORTHY!WARNING!  MAY CONTAIN UNHIDDEN SPOILERS!  PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!It’s time for a pair of creepies for Halloween! Stephen King's third published novel is the only one of his that I really like. I've read several and never found another one which matches this one. My problem with King is that he reached a point shortly after this novel where he couldn't tell a story without telling the entire history of every character in the story, and it’s quite simply b-o-r-i-n-g! This novel wasn't. It was a bit long, but it had enough weirdness and action in it to keep it cooking beautifully. The way the hotel slowly absorbs King like a paper towel sucking up spilled tomato juice is delicious.The first time I ever read this was when I was working night shift at a place where I wasn't required to do a whole heck of a lot besides keep an eye on things, so it was a great time and place to read it, too.The novel begins with Jack Torrance, who has anger management issues and who is living on the edge, glad to finally get a job where he can get paid and also write. Which of us doesn’t dream of that?! The problem is that the job is caretaking the Overlook Hotel, which is a great place to stay in the summer, but which is totally cut off in the Colorado Rockies in winter, with no hope for outside help if anything goes wrong. Yeah - this is Stephen King, so you know everything is going to go wrong.So while it begins with Jack (yeah, I know, yet another novel with a character named Jack. Just grin and bear it. Sooner or later writers are going to tire of that name, and then we'll get some respite.), it’s really about his young son Danny. Danny is the one who shines - meaning, in King's bizarre and obscure lexicon, that he has telepathic and clairvoyant powers and sees spirits which, frankly, terrify him. The third character is Jack's wife, Wendy.Finally there's Dick Hallorann, the chef at the Overlook, who's headed for warmer climes for the winter. He discovers that Danny shines, and connects with him - telling him that if there's any trouble, Danny should just mentally call him, and he would come and help. Dick warns Danny not to go into a certain room, and to just ignore any spirits he might see here.Oh, there is one other character: Delbert Grady, a former caretaker who went beyond ""lost it"" one winter and killed his entire family, including himself. He never actually left the hotel, however, and now Danny is here, he's working inadvertently as a sort of amplifier for the evil that lurks within it’s very fabric and structure.The hotel wants to absorb Danny, but it can’t get him, so it turns attention upon the weakest link: Jack. Jack slowly starts losing it, especially when he has a fight with his wife and subsequently discovers that the hotel bar is fully stocked where it had previously been empty. Or it just his imagination?The more he's sucked in by the oppressive and all-pervasive evil atmosphere of the hotel, the more he feels pressure to do to his own family what Grady did to his. It’s not long before all-out hostilities break-out, with Jack getting locked in a pantry because he's downright dangerous, and Wendy locking herself in a room into which Jack tries to break before she cuts him with a knife.It’s at this point, where the whole hotel is coming alive and the creepiness factor is rapidly being dialed to eleven, that Danny lets out a massive mental shout for Dick, who gets it so hard that he almost collapses. He immediately sets off for the Overlook, not knowing how he will ever get there, but determined to do so.One thing Jack neglects in his single-minded pursuit of Danny - so that he can turn him over to the hotel, is the hotel boiler, which 'creeps', and which will explode if not frequently attended to. This is what eventually takes out Jack, as Wendy and Danny escape with Dick.This novel is nothing short of brilliant and I highly recommend it if by chance you haven't read it yet.",5

"5271","DARK AGENDA: The War to Destroy Christian…","Dark Agenda exposes the assault of progressivism on America’s conservatism and Judeo-Christianity","Dr. Miguel A. Faria","163006114X","RMKKPGTS2JRA3","1556087565","Dark Agenda — The War to Destroy America by David Horowitz  is another masterpiece tome by a prolific and relentless conservative warrior who has previously exposed and documented in a series of now classic books the destructive and malevolent history of the New Left from the 1960s to the present. These books include such tour de force tomes as Destructive Generation: Second Thoughts About the Sixties (with Peter Collier; 1989),  Radical Son—A generational Odyssey (1998), and more recently the Black Book of the American Left (2016). His new book is a little different, considering that Horowitz was a former communist progressive, who is still an agnostic Jew and independent thinker, even if he is now an uncompromisingly leader of the conservative movement.Dark Agenda is an expose of the left’s savage war against God and Christianity with the goal of replacing God with progressive socialist man as the ruling deity of social justice and the new world order. Horowitz points out that Christian principles were behind the guiding light of the American Revolution and the ideals bolstering the foundation of the American Republic. It is because of this Christian foundation as basis for moral principles, patriotism, and conservatism that liberals, from Margaret Sanger and Christopher Hitchens to Ted Kennedy and Barack Obama, have waged an unremitting war against Christianity, subtly in the case of some and not so subtly in the case of others. The Judeo-Christian ideals upon which this nation was founded are abhorrent to the new left and the Democrat party because they are an obstacle to government usurpation. Along the way, Horowitz also exposes the atheistic and radical objectives of such organizations as the ACLU and the judicial activism of the courts in banning prayer from schools and Christian symbols from public buildings. At the same time religious speech has been disallowed in political discourse, and Christianity itself extricated from the popular culture. He does not forget to describe and document the virulent hatred of liberal atheists toward those who espouse Christianity and conservatism. I recommend this book without reservations as a masterful and energetic, yet captivating defense of the defining principles of conservatism and the American Republic. It is clear, eloquently-written, passionate and well-documented. If you are conservative, you will love this book; if politically neutral, it should persuade you to critically think and perhaps erase the mist of biased obfuscation and misinformation with which we are daily assaulted; if bleeding heart liberal, it may upset and shame you!Miguel A. Faria, M.D. is an Associate Editor in Chief in socioeconomics, politics, medicine, and world affairs of Surgical Neurology International (SNI). He is the author of Vandals at the Gates of Medicine (1995); Medical Warrior: Fighting Corporate Socialized Medicine (1997); and Cuba in Revolution — Escape From a Lost Paradise (2002).

It was advertised on the Golf Channel and, since it was co-written by James Patterson, I assumed it would be a mystery set on the links of the fabled Royal and Ancient Golf course at St Andrews. It's not and that was disappointing as I enjoy mysteries. But I love golf so I stuck with it. The novel is about fifty-four year-old golfer, Travis McKinley, who washes out of the Senior Tour and then tries to figure out what to do with the rest of his life. He has a wife, two sons and a daughter who are undeveloped characters, (we don't find how his wife manages to support the family until the rather bizarre excerpt at the back of the book). Travis, on the other hand who has no income, makes a stab at the Senior Q school and broadcasting. The plot is as thin as a bad tee shot and there is a great deal of ""product placement"" which leads me to believe this was solicited as monetary insurance in case sales didn't measure up. If there is one saving grace it's for those of us to who love the sport The reader can imagine playing a round with old Travis McKiney knowing how it feels to hit the ball into the bunker or miss an easy putt. Tiger Woods makes an appearance on these pages along with other pros most people would recognize from their heyday. So if you like playing golf you may well enjoy the book. If not, it could be a miracle if readers found it captivating.",3

because I didn’t want to be in the wine press anymore. I said to the Lord, “I give up, you can keep the blessings because the testing is too hard!” This book has me looking from God’s perspective and His strategy to fulfill His divine purpose for my life. If you’re in the “crushing” season, this book is for you. If you’re not being crushed right now, this book is for you too, because it will better help you understand the “why” when everything falls apart.

"5307","The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life","A Book for A New Life","Aran Joseph Canes","0812993268","R3PVRC11ZZ3JUP","1556094200","The most valuable and insightful idea of Brooks's book is that of the 'Weavers' -- those who pick us up out of the chaos of the rush to accumulate, grab, and rush in a narcissistic, 'selfie' culture where we have forgotten to recognize others -- and the real community that we must retrieve again. His words remind me of Merton, and recalls to mind Christopher Lasch's 'The Culture of Narcissism', which was a prescient call to many of the same things Brooks speaks of. Reviews here have denigrated Brooks as being hypocritical in his moral stance, because he left his wife. Did anyone consider the pain he might have been in because of that decision. We have no idea what personal pain he may have had. So that's absolutely a ridiculous argument in reviewing this book. It's a book that simply asks us to reconsider, or consider for the first time, where we are, as individuals, as a nation, and the repercussions of our culture's constant call to 'look out for yourself, don't worry about the other guy.' Self-awareness can include and embrace community. If we look in any mirror deeply, we will see, must see, many others in that reflection. Much like Marianne WIlliamson's call to love as a tool to acknowledging our damage and changing it, Brooks's call to reflection as action to change things limns the same call. I respect him greatly for his ability to have embraced his own vulnerability, and to use it to help us embrace our own -- to live up to what we've done, and take a first step to change.",4

I had just finished reading all five Song of Ice and Fire books before The Shining, so I was looking for a writing style that could compete with and keep me as entertained as George RR Martin's style.  King is truly a talented, brilliant writer.  I will say that I expected more 'horror' from this book in the traditional sense, but there is enough suspense to keep the reader captivated.  King's writing is detailed and incredibly descriptive.  He firmly establishes a persona for each character, and I was able to develop an empathetic connection to each.  Of course I couldn't NOT picture Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance, but the book is so much more than the movie.  From my recollection, the Kubrick film not only skips an enormous amount of detail, it also changes the story in a few key areas.  This is truly an outstanding read, and I will definitely read more by King in the future.",5

That's this book. It's so dense with good and useful information, and the recipes are beginning to end fantastic. We should expect nothing less from Carla Lalli Music who has been developing recipes forever. In fact, I'm finding that recipe developers often write the best, most useful cook books (think Alison Roman) because the recipe writing isn't the hardest part, so they can focus on making the cookbook actually usable on a daily basis for home cooks.My favorite parts so far are the techniques section with ""five ingredient"" suggestions to put the technique to use, and the ""spin it"" suggestions in every recipe that provide alternative pantry subsitutions that actually make sense and sound delicious.I mentioned that I haven't cooked even one recipe, however, I have purchased, borrowed, inherited and used many, many cookbooks and feel like I have something like a sixth sense about what will be frequently used (this book) and what won't (Ottolenghi's latest, which pains me).

It was a little slow start for me, but I finally was sucked into the story and could not put it down. I love Martha Hall Kelly’s historical fiction and am looking forward to her next book. I’m already anxiously waiting for the opportunity to devour the next Woolsey tale.

What a captivating story of life during the Bolshevik revolution. You will travel from the US to Russia to Paris…entrenched in the horrors of the Great War and the lives affected by war, atrocities, and many dangers. There are moments of holding your breath as you wait to discover what will happen next. There are many threads woven throughout the pages…love, loss, loyalty, faith, hope, altruism, danger, selfishness.

I am not as familiar with the First World War but the author does a great job of making you experience the emotions from the various corners of the world. The chapters of this book are presented from the viewpoint of three main characters. And the stories flow smoothly as you discover the richly drawn aspects of their lives and how they end up colliding in an astonishing way. You will be cheering on some of the characters while wishing others would meet with an unfortunate ending. Either way, you will be deeply invested in the story.

Scott","1984823191","R37TLOR00EITAI","1556127275","This was one of a couple of books that I had placed in my shopping list a while back and almost did not buy as I do not eat meat and this does have a few meat based dishes. But it kept showing up in various places that I routinely read - blogs, wellness websites, heck even my LinkedIn feed so I was intrigued enough to make the purchase and I am so glad I did.

It differs from your average cookbook as the recipes and lifestyle tips featured are from many health and wellness gurus as opposed to one author. People such as Mark Hyman, Kimberly Snyder, Amanda Chantal Bacon and Melissa Hensley. There are yoga people, doctors , celebrities known for wellness, lifestyle experts so this book is just an overall wellness guide peppered with short anecdotes with tips, stories or advice.

The thing I ADORE about this book is the variety of innovative, interesting fresh dishes that I will use time and time again. Using different people results in so much diversity you will never get bored.

There were some really interesting breakfasts such as a really pretty blue magic smoothie bowl that can be whipped up in seconds to a strawberry CBD smoothie with basil and a coffee smoothie that can replace the kids favorite frappuccino sneaking in cauliflower and taking out the sugar!

The ‘Light Fare’ section begins with a spiced eggplant dish from Top Chefs Parma Lakshmi then contains dishes from jalapeño pancakes, to a light Gazpacho dish , salads, slaws and soups. The nut and seed bread is simple to whip up and a fiber powerhouse.

The mains have a mix of meat, fish and vegetarian / vegan dishes. Some are simple comforting dishes such as warned lentils with a poached egg to more complex dishes but still easy enough that I would try and tackle.

Sweets and snacks had some interesting surprises such as Kombucha gunnies. The tahini fudge is delicious and I have made a big batch to keep on hand when ever a sugar craving hits. However it’s not all sweet and I particularly love the fact they have a sweet onion dip that uses cashews as the base.

There is a large and really interesting drinks section with alcoholic choices, spritzers, CBD coffee , matcha and activated charcoal lattes and some night time drinks that prepare you for ‘hot sex’ or ‘sweet dreams’

I cannot believe I nearly passed on this book. I love it and will use it a lot. Cannot wait to sip on some of their lattes this weekend while I decide what dish to make next.",4

"5426","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","Beautiful Writing, Slow Burning Suspense!","L. Williams","0062678426","R24JG2IJGHB2BR","1556132173","When I first started hearing about this book a few months ago, I was immediately intrigued. A book about a woman who watches her neighbors through her window and sees something horrible, but no one believes her? Rear Window, the Alfred Hitchcock film starring Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, is one of my favorite movies of all time, and with a plot that seemed to mirror that of the film, The Woman in the Window seemed like it was written just for me.Once I started reading The Woman in the Window, I realized quickly that it is definitely not a carbon copy of Rear Window. The influence of classic Hitchcock films is undeniable, but The Woman in the Window is definitely a powerful force of its own. The book is told from the perspective of Dr. Anna Fox, a child psychologist whose agoraphobia has confined her to her own home for ten months. She spends her days playing online chess, counseling others with agoraphobia in an online community, drinking much more wine than she should, and watching her neighbors through the window with the zoom lens on her camera. When a new family moves in to a neighboring house, she witnesses something horrible that leaves her determined to convince everyone else that what she saw was real, in spite of her heavy dosages of medication and the several bottles of wine she drank that day that lead them to believe she imagined the entire thing.The Woman in the Window is unlike most other thrillers I have read. In fact, classifying this book as simply a thriller does a serious injustice to A.J. Finn's writing. Finn has crafted a magnificent novel with a literary fiction feel that also leaves readers anxious from start to finish. By telling the story from Anna's perspective, Finn has allowed readers to dive deeply into the complicated tangle of her mind and thoughts, and as she begins to question her own sanity, so does the reader. Her own story and the source of her agoraphobia unfold slowly through her conversations with her husband, from whom she is separated and has not seen during her period of confinement, and the details she reveals to a woman she meets in her agoraphobia community online.In the beginning, Anna’s reliance on multiple bottles of wine each day, her irresponsible methods for taking her medication, and her disregard for personal hygiene made her difficult for me to reach. As her depression became more clearly defined, my attitude toward her turned to empathy, and I became deeply invested in her. I found myself desperately wanting to believe her and desperate for her to prove herself to those around her. The more invested I became, the more blindsided and shocked I felt by each twist in the story...and there were several.The Woman in the Window is a perfect read for those who enjoy slow burning thrillers that focus on deep character development through compelling writing. As someone who enjoys classic films, I especially appreciated the suspense of the book that left me feeling terrified without the gore and sensational violence typical of modern works. Instead, The Woman in the Window got inside my head, made me question everything I thought I knew about what Anna saw, and held on so tightly that I couldn't put the book down until I finished.",5

The success of this novel reinforces the pattern (vicious circle?) of publishing knock off novels of other successful books by the Big Six, mixing and matching proven formulas like Lego blocks. The author has an inventive and often surprising usage of words, especially verbs, which compensates, to a degree, for the fact that his novel--from the name of the author to  every last detail-- is a collection of ideas and tricks which have been all done before, successfully, in other novels. *For more on this read the review in the New Yorker.His referencing of other books and movies can get over the top  and tedious, and I skipped most passages where he intercut relevant dialog picked from various movies with his own action.Overall l really liked the novel, but the lack of authenticity stopped me from truly loving it. I think Gone Girl is much better, those this novel too, has bits that are truly amazing.It is a great first book though.

Finn deftly uses superior character development of agoraphobic Dr. Anna Fox and photographically-detailed descriptions of her environment * to lure readers into engagement, to lull readers into semi-complacent comprehension at certain times, and to ultimately leave readers open-mouthed yet satisfied at the complexly-constructed bombshells in The Woman in the Window. “Good” red herrings are evident. Concatenations of events unobtrusively lead the reader to her/his own conclusions — until, that is, astonishing but not-unreasonable twists dash those judgments. As a Turner Classic Movies junkie, I applaud how this novel pays skillful homage to classic cinematic thrillers. The titles, actors, plots, and even dialogue snippets from these movies not only creatively delineate Dr. Anna's psyche and circumstances, but also nudge the reader toward correct — and a few incorrect — predictions throughout the novel. Although much of the plot is spent in time-shifting, alcohol-and-prescriptive-drug-induced blurs, structurally, the novel hurtles forward: physical chapters are brief and often semi-cliff-hanging, urging the reader to read just a few pages more. **In summary, The Woman in the Window is a compact, sophisticated chiller with a complex, fully-realized main character and enough sly plot twists to catch the reader off-guard, but admiringly so.*Read the book to see what I did there....** Notably, I voluntarily increased my treadmill time while reading this book at the gym.",4

I ventured into the thriller world this summer and have thus far binged 'Girl on the Train', 'Gone Girl', 'Sharp Objects', 'The Girl Before', 'Before I Go To Sleep' and the other major hits. This, I believe has the best writing.I love an unreliable narrator. Her alcoholism and drug abuse meant that you really couldn't predict what was going on (very Girl On The Train-ish). She was also a psychologist (like myself) and Finn captured the way our minds work PERFECTLY! The frequent plot twists and gripping suspense right to the very end made it so yummy. Finn wrapped up the ending nicely, with a '*pat,pat* - here you go'. No dragging things out or sentimentality but no lingering questions either.Not too emotional, not too gruesome, not 'too much' in any way. Just beautiful metaphors, page turning narrative and an unpredictably good story. Worth the buy. Worth every cent of my broke pocket.Keep bringing it Finn!",5

But now she is a shell of her former self, estranged from her family and friends and trapped in her New York City mansion by a debilitating case of agoraphobia. Lonely and depressed, Anna spends her days drinking too much wine, watching classic suspense films and spying on her neighbors through the lens of her camera. Late one night, she witnesses a woman being stabbed, but when the police arrive, her neighbors deny that any crime took place. Given the high level of alcohol in Anna’s system and her history of mental instability, the police conclude that she imagined the incident. Desperate to prove her sanity and solve the mystery, Anna continues her surveillance. But strange things begin to happen around her and soon, even Anna herself begins to doubt what she really saw that night.As a few other reviewers have noted, “The Woman in the Window” shares a few similarities with several other recently published books (most notably “The Girl on the Train”). Both books feature an unreliable female narrator with a drinking problem, and both characters have  trouble separating reality from delusion. Both stories are full of twists and turns, and both will keep you guessing until the very last page.Throughout the book, the author includes intermittent fragments of dialogue from the movies that Anna is watching. Those bits of music, pieces of dialogue and flashes of movie images act almost like background noise and really add an extra dimension to those scenes.If you like mysteries, psychological thrillers or suspenseful movies (especially those with unexpected twists), then this is a MUST READ!",5

I never accepted that this story, however, while reading it, nor can I now, took place in Manhattan. Yes, there are “houses” in Manhattan. Townhouses. But, they’re all lined up. And, sure, Harlem’s a good choice. The West Village may have been better. But, it FEELS like it takes place in an upper class suburbia (multilevel, single-family dwellings, side windows, homes across small parks, driveways, a handful of neighbors rather than scores, the claustrophobia AND accessibility unique to “bedroom communities”). Perhaps, in Connecticut. Or, Rhode Island. Or, just upstate of Manhattan. It’ll be interesting to see if the filmmakers retain the distracting-whenever-mentioned urban setting.

Isolated and unhappy, she starts to live out the plot of Rear Window (that particular movie is not mentioned) by piecing together stories about her neighbours through her extraordinarily good view from her window. Whoever approved the alignment of those houses should be castigated for giving such easy viewing pleasure.Surprise, surprise, she witnesses a murder and launches into one of those creepy Hitchcock situations where nobody will believe her. This is where the story becomes implausible, with one of the most polarised and unrealistic ""good cop, bad cop"" routines ever. Police might be cynical and overworked, but they don't spend hours talking over some woman who is trying to report a crime. They don't give a nuisance witness their direct numbers so she can call them at 2 in the morning. They don't tell the witness in front of a potential suspect that she's crazy. They either investigate briefly, or they nod politely and go onto the next real crime. Also witness statements are shaky at best, so nothing beats visiting the scene of the alleged crime to check for physical evidence. This complete absence of any physical evidence or any other independent witness reports creates a glaring gap in the story.By the time the villain was revealed, it was an anti-climax, especially as the villain delivered a long monologue gleefully describing every stereotypical life event that led -- to choose evil as a career path.",3

"5523","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","This year's best-selling psychological thriller","Richard B.  Schwartz","0062678426","R2Q928GTXKGP9V","1556183833","So, A. J. Finn is actually Dan Mallory, who worked in publishing for Morrow and Little, Brown UK.  He uses a gender-free pseudonym for various reasons, one of which is to keep his authors (i.e. the authors whose books he acquired) to keep from freaking out if and when they see his actual name on a jacket in a window display or a point-of-purchase rack.  He likes French bulldogs, suffered for years from clinical depression, dislikes President Trump, is gay and now, a millionaire.  THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is this year’s GONE GIRL and THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, the latter owing great debts (along with THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW) to Hitchcock’s REAR WINDOW.  The film of the novel is due out in fall, 2019, with Amy Adams in the title role and Gary Oldman and Julianne Moore supporting.  Can you say mucho dinero?But what of the book?  I seldom read best-sellers because they generally fall short of expectations.  While unique in their sales they are often derivative in their conceptions.  That is certainly true of THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW but the book did hold my attention.  It was well-plotted, contained some interesting characters, and was set in the now-gentrified Harlem.  It is a psychological thriller.  We learn this from the jacket design, promotional material and blurbs from practitioners of the genre.  The narrative itself, however, could have gone in any one of several directions: horror, amateur sleuth or even mainstream fiction.  Since the narrator is unreliable, a switcheroo twist and/or ending could have presented us with a very different form of story.  One possibility, e.g.: the challenged person whose traumatic experience forces her out of her comfort zone and into a bit of personal redemption, as in, e.g., MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN or THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME.  Bottom line: the book draws on a number of potential (well-selling) antecedents.The concept:  Anna Fox is a child psychologist who has suffered a great deal of personal trauma.  She is now agoraphobic, confined to her multi-level home, where she lives with a cat named Punch and multiple cases of Merlot, which she mixes indiscriminately with a variety of strong medicines.  Often woozy and bored, she plays online chess, logs on to a site for agoraphobics and looks out her windows, utilizing the long lens of a camera (just like Jimmy Stewart) rather than a pair of binoculars.  On one such occasion she witnesses the murder of a woman she has recently met.  Or does she?  Is she simply delusional?  Does she have evil, ulterior motives?  Is everyone else wrong while she is right (even though drunk and, more or less, addicted)?Her interactions with a number of individuals (neighbors, a tenant, therapists of various types, police) constitute the principal plot arc.  The story, as expected, has multiple unexpected twists and turns and the ending contains key surprise elements.The book is ‘long’ and physically weighty, but it reads very quickly because it principally consists of dialogue and contains very short chapters with a great deal of white space.  The writing is brisk and highly competent but there is very little actual psychological or philosophic weight.  This is a best-seller that has mass-market appeal, not a book that you are likely to re-read.  (And not just because of the ending.  THE GREAT GATSBY has a surprise ending, but we re-read it constantly.)My advice: if this is your cup of tea, relish it.Four stars (but actually three and a half).",4

"5540","Someone Knows","Another great thriller from Lisa Scottoline","J.K","0525539646","R12GZF7IQRWGMG","1556185142","Lisa Scottoline is the author I always, always, always preorder and her latest novel Someone Knows once again demonstrates why. Scottoline has the ability to draw you completely into the story and to experience a full range of emotions. And she is spot on with her portrayal of the characters. Those teenagers felt so true. Reading Someone Knows I felt as if I was back in high school.

The story opens with Allie Garvey returning to the upscale Philadelphia suburb she grew up in for the funeral of a former classmate. A classmate that she shared a horrible experience and secret with, along with three other students, twenty years ago. Allie was an outsider then and she is an outsider now. She’s never gotten over the guilt about what happened and it’s affected every aspect of her life. When she reconnects with the last two remaining students, she sees the mean kids are now the mean adults. Are we already who we are going to be as adults by the time we are teenagers?

You know from the start that five kids went into the woods and four came out, so as each character is introduced you wonder if that’s the one. Every time they go into the woods you wonder if that’s the time. The suspense just keeps building.

After the funeral Allie is determined to find out what really happened once and for all. But it’s not as simple as that. There was so much more going on then, and now, than anybody realized. She and others are in real danger.

I couldn’t stop turning the pages. Each answer came with another question. As the action ramped up the chapters got shorter and shorter. I wanted to know what happened but at the same time was almost afraid to find out. And the ending – wow! I thought I was at the end more than once because the story had come to a very satisfactory conclusion. But Scottoline wasn’t done yet, and off we went again. I did not see the ending coming but it worked perfectly. As always, I thoroughly enjoyed this latest Lisa Scottoline book, highly recommend it and can’t wait for the next one. I purchased my copy of Someone Knows and all opinions are my own.",5

"5549","Trillion Dollar Coach: The Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley's Bill Campbell","The simple brilliance of Bill Campbell in coaching Silicon Valley leaders.","Don Hutchison","0062839268","R3KX35A8GLCQEG","1556185749","Bill Campbell was an extraordinary coach who strongly influenced many founders and leaders of successful Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Apple, Next Door and Intuit. He was known as ‘Coach’, owing to his prior career in college football, and long interest in coaching business teams. A revered figure among those who knew him, he did not seek and generally did not receive the sort of public adulation someone of his skill and success might receive. Those who knew Coach well felt he was the real deal and his methods of leadership were too valuable to perish with the man.

That conviction drove this succinct, enjoyable work. Bill’s impact is reflected by the accomplished executives who felt compelled to author this book and the scores of others touched by Bill who happily contributed their time and love in an attempt to meaningfully sketch the man, his ideas and personality.

Among many key leadership truths Bill intuitively or experientially divined:

--Results matter. Achieving operational excellence grows leaders and opportunity.
--Coach the coachable. Not everyone is a candidate.
--Effective leaders are humble, good listeners and focus on others--the whole other.
--Great results take teams; well-coached teams are more likely to succeed.
--Coach from a posture of candor and support—infuse energy, courage and belief.
--People excel in trusted environments where they feel valued and appreciated.
--Framing matters: focus on the issues up for debate by agreeing on ‘first principles.’
--Consider potential: comes up to speed quickly, works hard, honest and has grit.
--Trust defines relationships and is earned.
--Be generous.

Bill was unique. This gifted man combined piercing insights, an authentic interest in those he met, and a frank desire for success, in a loud, outgoing, profane personality, while doing his best work quietly, one on one. What he learned, applied and shared is accessible to anyone willing to read, consider and practice.

And practice some more.

Read the book and see what you think. My bet is you’ll find it one of the better leadership volumes you’ll read this or any year.",5

"5577","Working","An engaging (exciting, even) memoir/masterclass","Charles C. Euchner","0525656340","R3SLEEX9XA18KD","1556187413","When you talk about the subjects of Robert Caro’s magisterial, Pulitzer Prize-winning biographies–Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson–you have to look at them from two perspectives.

Before Caro, or B.C., they were viewed as great men whose legacy was marred by their personal flaws. This conventional wisdom is true as far as it goes, but it’s been told so often, and in such familiar ways, that it begins to take on a cartoonish quality. I remember the celebrations of presidents at one of the Democratic conventions describing Johnson as having a heart “as big as Texas.” That’s how you described Johnson: Like other successful politicians, only bigger.

Except that neither Moses or Johnson was anything like the complex, Shakespearean figures that Caro has revealed in his works. After Caro, these two figures–and dozens of other supporting characters, like Moses’s mentors Al Smith and Belle Moskowitz, or LBJ’s mentor Sam Rayburn, to take a few examples–are pulsing with energy. Just as important, these works are also pulsing with whole new ways of looking at the world.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is about a good a definition of genius that you’ll ever find.

How does he do it? The simple, and true, answer is that he researches the hell out of his subjects. Fans complain that Caro is taking too long with the fifth volume of The Years of Lyndon Johnson, covering his five-plus years in the White House. But as Caro explains, there is no other way:

""While I am aware that there is no Truth, no objective truth, no single truth, no truth simple or unsimple, either; no verity, eternal or otherwise; no Truth about anything, there are Facts, objective facts, discernible and verifiable. And finding facts–through reading documents or through interviewing and re-interviewing–can’t be rushed; it takes time. Truth takes time.""

Researching the hell out of his subjects is just one of the many lessons for writers in Caro’s new book ""Working: Researching, Interviewing, Writing"" (Knopf, April 9). Caro’s brief work–and, by the way, this is the first and last time the words “Caro” and “brief” will ever appear in the same sentence–offers a master course in the art and craft of writing.

In this little book, Caro shows how and why he picked his subjects, how to find the throughline and plot the story’s arc, how to conduct archival research and interview subjects, how to write great scenes, explain complex processes, how to write with style, and much more.

I was a 13 year old growing up in Sacramento when the EAR terrorized his first victim (1976). He eventually struck in my neighborhood in Foothill Farms in attack #25 (1977). The book is definitely a fantastically interesting read. McNamara captures the essence of the 1970s Sacramento suburbs and other California locales of the numerous disturbing and horrific attacks by including area history, environment, and architecture in her prose. McNamara presents a remarkable view of the detectives, both the ones who worked the original cases and those who work the oh-so-cold cases now, and the hidden torment associated with their inability to snare this very prolific and very brutal animal.  I retired as a police officer and former detective (28 1/2 years) in 2016. Trust me when I say the author presents a sincere and beautifully written book that examines more than just the numbing details of each EAR attack. If you are looking for a sequential case by case page turner (of which a couple of well written books of those type are available), this book is not it. This book is not only about the EAR, this author places depth on DNA evidence and development and, more importantly, how the EAR crimes affected victims, victim families, police, McNamara herself, and whole communities as this rapist killer cloaked them all in his terror.

"5618","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","All Stiva, No Lev","Mary E. OBrien","0143110438","R24I1E42Z6JEE8","1556201117","On the plus side, the novel is engaging, and entertaining; consistently held my interest.My reservations are mainly based on the lack of plausibility of some aspects of the plot.Alexander Rostov is a former aristocrat in post-Revolutionary Russia.  The blood-thirsty Bolsheviks sentence him to life in posh hotel, mainly because they believe that he may organize a military  threat against their corrupt regime.  Tyranny is sometimes capricious.The reason they don't kill Rostov outright is that he is (falsely) believed to be the author of a pre-revolutionary  poem.  The poem was actually written by his college friend, Mischko.  The aristocrat is great friends with this  Communist intellectual; though they don't seem to have anything in common.Rostov doesn't seem to care much that he is now relegated to a tiny room in the hotel attic; similarly to  Dr. Zhivago's attitude on losing his grand home.  The finances of this arrangement are  never specified.  Have the Bolsheviks paid up his room rent into perpetuity?  Or is the room doled out by the state, like the regular apartments were?  He eats all of his meals in the fancy restaurants inside the hotel.  The other guests in the hotel pay for their rooms & meals.  By luck, the Bolsheviks did not take his desk, which has a stock of gold coins; so he  is not penniless.  But how he pays normal living expenses is not explained.After a while, he does take a position in one of the fine restaurants; but this move seems more motivated by boredom than financial need.In this strange situation, hard to believe that Rostov would trust the Bolsheviks to just leave him alone for any length of time.  Any sensible man would plot to escape as soon as possible, not hang around for 30 years.The beginning of the book seems to flatter the Bolsheviks.  Rostov observes that their behavior at a political meeting is analogous in some ways to behavior of the aristocrats at a social event; both groups honor senior members, and so forth.  Of course, he might find just as many parallels observing the monkey cage at the local  zoo.At first, the author minimizes the faults of the Bolsheviks;  painting a ""Norman Rockwell"" view of Communism.  A strain of this attitude continues throughout the whole book.  The Bolsheviks are at worst lovable clods;  a girl is saved from an orphanage on the rumor that she is the illegitimate daughter some party favorite.  Another time, the same girl is rescued from forced relocation away from Moscow to a remote city, when Rostov's girlfriend suggests that one of the  party bosses has an interest in her.  The people all bend over backwards like fools to avoid offending their “highnesses.”The author's purpose is to attempt to  resolve an unresolvable political contradiction:  he is a product of Yale U, one of the most elite institutions in the world; yet the entire curriculum there is Marxist.The author doesn't touch  the real meaning of being an aristocrat.  To him, aristocrats are just silly little men who have too strong a taste for luxury, and use artificial ""manners"" to charm people.The book references Tolstoy often.  The main character's family name is Rostov, like Natasha's family in 'War & Peace.'  Why is it that so many contemporary novels  reference ""Anna Karenina""?Rostov is all Stiva, but no Lev;  all Pierre,  but  no Andrey.The reason that he returns to Russia after the Revolution doesn't make sense.  He states that he killed another  aristocrat.  The “victim” was trying to take  advantage of his beloved younger sister, tricking her into an engagement.  In fact, Rostov only injures him in a confrontation; but the cad manages to die in battle later on.  If he felt that he had killed a fellow Russian of his own social set, would that not be reason to stay away from Russia, rather than to go back? And, in those days, trying to dishonor his sister would have been considered sufficient cause to kill him anyway.  But more importantly, why did he never just  level with his sister that he didn't trust the guy?Another thing that makes no sense is Rostov's friendship with the 9yo Nina.  The type of conversations they have would be more natural if she were a middle-aged, middle-class woman:  for example, they talk about when to thank someone,  appreciating the work of others and why men fight duels.Where are the kid's parents?  Letting the child roam the hotel without  any supervision is a set-up for rape.  The situation just doesn't seem plausible; the author is just using the kid as a cute plot device to avoid dealing with the complexity of Rostov's sudden loss of  social standing.To even further exaggerate this plot problem, Nina grows up, and leaves her own 7yo daughter Sofia  with Rostov, and then mysteriously vanishes.  Rostov shares his 10x10 cell with Sofia for the next 10 years.  Again, where are this child's grand-parents?  Such circumstances  would be hellish: no privacy at all.Sofia, like Nina before her, wanders every hallway, servant's passage and sub-basement of the hotel.  Why isn't anyone concerned that for a child to be alone in these areas is dangerous?The author can't make the sympathetic orphan character a boy; however more believable the story might be.  Exploring the far reaches of the  hotel in such thorough detail would be more a young man's interest; but White males are too politically incorrect to use as characters in novels; so  authors too often use girls to embody  a boy personality, even when the resulting narrative is beyond belief.But then maybe the author was concerned that Rostov adopting a boy orphan might seem gay?",4

A career with more and varied experience usually produces important seasoning, wisdom and a sharpened awareness or judgment.

Karlgaard discusses the dynamics of fluid intelligence versus crystal intelligence. Fluidity deals more specifically with unstructured situations where people wait to gain more input and perspective before making a decision.

Late bloomers tend to demonstrate more curiosity, compassion, resilience bouncing back from adversity, tenacity and a modicum of self doubt. Older workers tend to bounce back from complacency and learn from past mistakes, as well as, lost opportunities.

Karlgaard explains that the executive functions tend to surface after the mid-twenties. He gives important credit to the iterative process of becoming wise due to a greater range of experiences.

The author explains how cognitive functions peak over time. For instance, people learn and remember names in their early 20s. Short term memory grows from the mid-twenties to mid-thirties. Face recognition becomes more pronounced in the early 30s. Social understanding peaks between the mid forties and mid fifties while verbal knowledge peaks in the mid-sixties. <pp.91>

For the workplace, older workers generally know the operations well enough to formulate a range of very good but not necessarily perfect solutions.Additionally, older workers can more readily identify classic pitfalls,as well as, solution sets that simply are not practical in implementation.

Overall, ""Late Bloomers"" by Rich Karlgaard is a welcoming treasure of new perspective on what older workers can bring to the table after years of experience and seasoning in life and the workplace. The book ends with nearly 50 pages of detailed notes which help to explain the contents of this most unusual book.",5

Not words I usually use, but Ahmed has written a story that is terrifying in its reality. As she says in the Author's Note, ""When fascism comes to America, it will come draped in the flag."". Such is the case here, the tale of what America could have been, is verging on becoming, *could still be*. A tale of Muslims, banned, then rounded up and put into internment camps. A tale of nationalism flowering at the highest levels of government. Where those who stand up, who resist, are the youth. And where those who resist may pay a heavy price.This is a hard book, and it seems like maybe not one to finish the year out with. But then again - it feels like the perfect book to finish this hellacious year out with, to start a new year more aware and stronger in will than before.The writing here is excellent. There isn't a lot of flowery language - it's spare and honest, as befitting a character...AN AMERICAN CITIZEN...stolen from her home, locked in a camp run by a man who feels that Muslims are ""vermin"". That reporters are ""fake news"". That ""People want to be happy in their ignorance."". If this all seems a little too on-point, that's because it is. And it could be sappy. Or weak. Or pushy. Or any other of a dozen ways this could have been a badly written story. But it's not - it's just a straight up gut-punch with the reality that THIS is truly a possibility.And in the end, we have the reality that THIS. IS. US. Americans have allowed this to happen before, and we're dangerously close to allowing it again. Ahmed reminds us that we are stronger together than apart, reminds us of the cost of being ""other"", reminds us of the cost of resisting - then reminds us that this - the hope, the resistance - this also is WHO. WE. ARE.",5

As the last editor of the distinguished culinary institution, she has been maligned and blamed for Gourmet's demise. She doesn't pull any punches and she states she should have seen it coming, but in her honest voice, I think it's obvious that the writing was on the wall even before she accepted the editor-in-chief gig.

I became a fan of the magazine in the 90s. The magazines that I have hoarded (some from Reichl's reign) are over the top Christmas catalogs full of all the things I coveted but would never have. Read ""luxury items"" and sometimes ultra-luxury at that. I was struck at her comment about wooing advertisers:

""...soon I understood that the magazine we were selling depended entirely on the needs of the client. Gourmet might be a lifestyle publication, a humble homemaker's bible, a travel magazine, or an epicurean pioneer. We might be upscale or strictly down-to-earth. On some days we emphasized the quality of our recipes; on others we acted as if they did not exist."" (88)

I think the magazine itself could not find its identity under this bipolar approach. Was it a lifestyle pub or a cooking magazine? I'm not sure it ever found out.

I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the big personalities and the politics that was and is Condé Nast. I relished (as with all of Reichl's writing) her honesty and description nature. As she lives out her dream and passion, the food narratives are imaginative. As she eats a ""chocolate concoction,"" she is put in a trance as the flavors of cream, butter, cognac and coffee mix together in the truffle. ""As the carousel of flavors whirled through my brain, I dreamed myself into a painting by Renoir. I was in a Paris restaurant at the turn of the century, gazing int an orange gilt-edged mirror"" (167).

My favorite section of the entire book was Chapter 15: Severine. She relates an over-the-top business trip to Paris. In an expensive vintage shop, she finds the perfect black dress. It was literally made for her. As she ponders the expensive price tag over dinner, she meets an older man that leads her to some truths. The entire chapter reads like a stand-alone short story.

Later, on a economically-themed Parisian trip, she encounters the same distinguished gentleman who feeds her more perfect bits of wisdom: ""Luxury is best appointed in small portions. When it becomes routine it loses its allure"" (246). This adage comes just as she starts to review her life at the magazine.

Reichl tries to take the blame and is devastated by the abrupt end, the end of the institution that was Gourmet and the end to the family that she created in her ten-year run as editor. She talks about that emotion and the healing process more in My Kitchen Year: 136 Recipes That Saved My Life. I'm glad she followed that work up with Save Me the Plums,. The ending of her current memoir is not dark dark and dire, it's uplifting and shows that with following a passion comes some heartache but we're always the better for it.",5

"5848","After (The After Series)","Just my opinon","want to read all day","1982111003","R29YMOPIQ8QPKS","1556269868","So I also read these books on Wattpad...and I have been reading all the reviews for this book because I knew that people were either going to love it or hate it and I was right. I consider myself to be a pretty serious reader and I have read a lot of ""romance"" novels. I have read FSOG and I am not sure why readers always feel that books are just a ""copy"" or a ""poorly written version"" of FSOG. Does any one remember that FSOG is a copy of Twilight. I don't think its fair to any author to compare everything to FSOG. FSOG is FSOG and that book had so many fans that I think readers are expecting everything they read to effect them like that series did. But honestly I have moved on. Me personally I don't want to read a book with any expectations. I think that's the point of reading different types of books. That being said some of the reviews that I have read talk about the 'abuse"". I think everyone is entitled to their own opinion. When I first started reading this book I have to say that I was like ""What the heck is this'. I was thinking ""Harry/Hardin is a complete a&*hat and I was like Tessa run for the hills"". Save yourself. LOL. That being said everyone has there own version of what abuse is. I found myself yelling at him for being a complete d#(*^bag and then yelling at her for putting up with it. It was hard to describe what I was feeling. That being said I also couldn't put it down. I mean I literally could not stop reading this book. Not because its some literary masterpiece. But because I had to know what was going to happen next. There was no part of this book that I wanted to skip ahead. I had to read every word because I have never read anything like it. Like I said earlier I read every chance I get everyday and I have read so many books of the bad boy meets the virgin and so forth and so on. Not that its a bad thing just after awhile its kinda like been there read that. I think that's why I gave this book 5 stars. Because it was different. And that's the biggest point to me is that it was different. I want t book to entrance me, make me laugh, make me cry, make me want to throw my kindle, make me shout at the characters. Isn't that the point of reading...There are books out there with far more 'abuse"" than this one trust me I have read some of them. Relationships in real life are not always fluffy with rainbows and butterflies. Sometimes they are in your face like this book. And for me this was something that you don't usually see in a book and it was more of a reason to keep reading than to stop reading it. I am usually the person in my circle of readers to suggest books or if they ask me to I will give them my opinion on a book they are thinking of reading. When it came to this book I told everyone to just read it. I told them to expect Harry/Hardin to be a complete a$$ and I told them that Tessa just put up with his crap and kept coming back for more. They both knew their relationship was not a healthy one they both say it. I told them that their fights were intense and their sex was intense but I didn't tell them not to read it. I would never tell someone not to read something because every book is different to every reader. Which again to me is the point of reading in the first place. So I say if you are not sure you want to read this book based on the reviews that you have seen so far that's your decision...however if you want to read a non-typical book about a bad boy meets the virgin and you don't mind it being in your face and not rainbows and butterflies than get in your comfy spot and get a pillow and a blanket cause you wont want to put this book down. And lets try an remember that reading is a form of entertainment and what's entertaining to some may not be entertaining to others. Also for the review that said something about readers being over 40 might not like it I have to say I am well over 40. LOL. I don't think age has anything to do with it. Its just different people like different things. I hope this review helps someone. Also I have to say toAnna Todd I am sure you knew when you wrote this that you were going to have readers that were not going to like this series but for me I have to say ""go ahead girl'. I couldn't put it down and for me that says something.",5

Agoraphobia usually involves fear of crowds, bridges, or of being outside alone.Extreme agoraphobic Anna hasn't left her house in months. Instead, she lives alone popping pills like candy, drinking bottles of wine...and watching her neighbors. She knows their names, who is cheating on who, and their daily routines. When a new family moves in across the street, Anna becomes fixated on this mysterious new family. When she meets the son, Ethan, she forms a mental attachment to them, especially after meeting and befriending the wife, Jane.When Anna hears a scream and then sees Jane stabbed and bloody, she immediately calls the police. When the police think she's a drunk that's making things up for attention, and everyone denies that anything happened, Anna starts to wonder whether or not she can trust herself...I heard so much about The Woman in the Window before I got around to reading my copy, so I was really excited to read it! Part of me was worried about how hyped up it was, because as I'm sure you all know, that can sometimes lead to disappointment. I'm glad to say that this was not the case for me while reading this book!The Woman in the Window features an unreliable and unlikeable narrator, along the same lines as The Girl on the Train, so if you liked that book you'll definitely want to check this one out! While I was rooting for Anna, I also wanted to shake her until she got her life together!While reading the book, I had so many questions - where is Anna's family? What happened to her that caused her to be agoraphobic? Why does she spy on her neighbors? I was able to guess quite a bit of the ending and resolution, but I didn't completely solve the mystery! There are multiple twists and turns throughout the story, which I really enjoyed, and ultimately all of my questions were answered in due time.While the book was a mystery and did have a thriller aspect to it, it didn't really pick up for me until the last third or so of the book, and at that point I didn't want to put it down and ended up staying up too late to finish the book! All in all, I rated the book 4 stars, and would recommend this one to fans of thrillers with narrators who are flawed. I'd like to thank Edelweiss, William Morrow, and A.J. Finn for an advanced copy of the book. It was my pleasure to provide an honest review.",4

I'm also super excited to try out all the mead recipes!

That being said, the bread ingredient ratios are way off - if you bake the Honey Lavender Bread and the Braided loaf exactly according to instructions, the end products are insanely dry. So, be careful with the whole wheat flour proportions and be prepared to experiment a little bit/maybe reference a dedicated bread baking text alongside this book.

I think it was well written. And I appreciated the short chapters.BUT I agree with many reviewers about some its shortcomings:1) This book is literally Girl on the Train. Full stop. I almost can't believe the author and/or publisher didn't notice that (or maybe they did.) Make it New York instead of London. Drunk agoraphobe instead of just plain drunk. And they are the same book. Plot, twists, everything is the same. I think Girl on the Train (which itself was a remake of Rear Window) was actually a stronger book because the ending was more surprising.2) I don't understand how people are saying the ""twist"" at the end is ""shocking."" This book is anything but shocking. There are only like 3 other characters in the book! So assuming Punch (the cat) didn't do it and the woman didn't stab herself, then you have a pretty good chance of guessing whodunit.3) This book felt so long (sooo long) unnecessarily. I could have sliced a significant portion of the middle right out and it wouldn't have affected the book. I understand the writer was trying to show a day-by-day diary of this woman's life for a two week period. But her daily life was incredibly boring. She is an agoraphobe after all. It all felt very repetitive. Swallow pills, drink Kirkland merlot, watch movie, spy on your neighbors. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat...So, I'm happy I bought the book.

This especially rings true to me after reading ""The Shining"" which tells the story of Jack Torrance's struggle with remaining in control of his own actions and keeping his family safe from other things along with himself. Jack has made mistakes in the past and hurt his family do to his drinking but is really trying to start new but dealing with the struggles of trying not to drink, keeping his anger in check, doing what is best for his family. Jack's wife Wendy is trying to keep her son safe and help her husband, her biggest struggle is that she tries to trust Jack but at some points finds herself hating him. Jack's son Danny is young but has a very strong power that he later learns from the caretaker to refer to as a shine, gives him premonitions of things to come as well as some telepathy. Danny knows to much for his own good and understands that something is wrong with the hotel the Overlook but does not know how to explain it to his parents. Danny tries to save his dad and mom but does not know what to do and if his premonitions will even come true.

And as usual I really enjoyed it.  CJ Box is a fantastic story teller and writes page turners that I can't put down.  This book is easy to read with intriguing story lines.  It starts as a bit of a slow burn but has a ton of action towards the end.  Overall, very satisfying book.There were, however, a couple of things I didn't love.  First, there was less of Joe's family involvement in this story which is disappointing.  The reason I fell in love with this series is that you feel like a part of the Pickett family, watching the kids grow up and seeing how Joe and Marybeth navigate the minefield of parenthood.  I know the kids are older now, but I would still like to see more of the story revolve around the Pickett family.  Second, I am getting a little weary of crazy shoot-em-out stories with Joe.  I'd like to see CJ Box go back to story's that have simpler investigations.  Doesn't mean it has to be a simple story, but can have twists and turns and be a true mystery with depth.  Joe is not some bad ass ex-military guy.  Keep it simple with him.  Then have Nate out there kicking major ass in a side story line.  That's what I'm looking for.Regardless, it's still a fun read and I can't wait for more Joe Pickett adventures.  It's one of my favorite series out there and a must read every year.",4

The subject, for one -- I mean, Audrey Hepburn! And the approach: Author Robert Matzen has written eight books, Dutch Girl being the third in a trilogy on well-known actors and World War II.

There's no question that the book was exhaustively researched. There is so much information that was new to me about Hepburn's aristocratic family and their role in the fight against fascism (or, in some cases, for it.)

Still, despite intriguing material and meticulous cross-referencing, the book was hard to read. Occasionally the alternating timelines got in the way. More often, reading Dutch Girl reminded me of what I dislike about televised true crime shows, where snippets of dialogue or graphic images are repeated so often that it feels like 15 minutes of content were ""crammed into"" a 43-minute (plus commercials) production.

Dutch Girl had lots of repetition and a good bit of rambling. It felt as if the author felt he had to honor his (undeniably good) material by casting and recasting it in a different setting.

This book is worth reading, and much of it is memorable. It simply cried out for a rigorous edit. Thanks to NetGalley for an advance readers copy.",5

I wish I had gotten it from the library rather than paid for it, but at least it was under $5 when I got it.  I don't really regret reading it, but it's not a book I'm going to recommend either.  It has had the kind of hype that ""connected"" authors get, but despite the author's bio which trots out his study of suspense and thrillers, I feel like he didn't really use what he'd learned in this book.  It falls in that chasm between literary fiction and mysteries, and though I enjoy both, I often find that the literary authors really needed to commit more to the genre they're writing in.The first, say, 50% was particularly slow going, so slow that I thought, well, I must have misunderstood and this is not a thriller at all.  I laughed at times, and was engaged enough to keep reading (on a day too hot to go outdoors, when I had nothing else to read), but I was really simply forcing myself to get through it.  The set up was predictable:  of course no one believes the narrator who is an alcoholic who is mixing heavy duty psych meds with her merlot.  It didn't really start getting interesting until the very end.  I did appreciate a couple of twists, so it's not like I hated the book--I just also didn't really enjoy it, and just finished it because I started it.  I think the author could have done a better job of making the first part of the book a bit more suspenseful, if it was to be a thriller.Not worth they hype, that's for sure.",3
"6024","The Mueller Report: The Final Report of the Special Counsel into Donald Trump, Russia, and Collusion","Falsified Promises of Indictment","Philter","1510750169","R3ERI8A3HHU4U0","1556285206","At the source of the Mueller Report was a paid dossier by the Hillary Campaign and the DNC. Hillary loyalists, as well as never-Trumpers, spread the claims of the Russian dossier (opposition research) to the FBI which used it to spy on an American citizen connected to the Trump campaign. Eventually, the spying expanded and names were unmasked. Former FBI director James Comey notified then President-Elect Trump of the dossier. Leaks to the media began to happen. Hillary loyalists were overwhelmed with joy with the thought of a Russian conspiracy which might remove Trump from office. CNN and MSNBC ran continual coverage of a Russian conspiracy for over 2 years. Democratic Representatives, as well as so-called news hosts, made wild claims that there was hard evidence of collusion with Russia and this evidence would be used by Mueller to indict Trump. As a result, they thought this would be enough to impeach the President.

As Allan Dershowitz rightfully points out in the introduction of this book, there was a conflict of interest and there shouldn't have been a special counsel appointed in the first place! Mueller and Comey were close working buddies and the Mueller team consisted of a lot of people who donated to the Hillary campaign. But after squeezing the President's inner circle where he charged them with crimes unrelated to the investigation or during the process of the investigation and reviewing thousands of pages of documents Mueller decided not to indict on the conspiracy with Russia allegation. He left the obstruction of justice allegation up to the AG, but Barr concluded he wasn't going to indict either.

This report is a great read, taxpayers spent millions of dollars on this political investigation and you should read it. Mueller did give his Democratic friends something to keep the investigation going for as long as the President remains in office. But not for justice, the report falsified promises of an indictment. The ongoing investigations are intended solely on undermining President Trump!",4

"6029","Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion","Comfort to the Christians","Marty B","1433564238","ROZJQ8T08YP1H","1556285702","Confronting Christianity: 12 Hard Questions for the World's Largest Religion by Rebecca McLaughlin is a fairly short volume that strives to confront twelve hard questions for the Christian faith. While the objective is noble, I can’t really say that there’s much confrontational in the pages of this book, if you are a Christian. Maybe one could say that this strips back the often overheated rhetoric of partisan figures who ground dubiously Christian activities in selective and questionably accurate readings of biblical texts, but confrontational it isn’t.

I guess the central question I have after reading this book is: Who is the audience for this text and why should they care? Many of the Christians I know as people already act as though the vision of Christianity outlined by McLaughlin is settled fact and the guiding force of their lives.

If you are trying to get people into Christianity, the approach in this book comes across more as though one is introducing a little kid to something that scares them like “It’s okay, God won’t hurt you” than a deep examination of the vast Christian faith.

If it’s aimed at the lapsed and partisan, I don’t know how much the latter folks are going to be helped by being told their vision of the faith is wrong and the former have reasons for drifting from the faith that this positivist view of Christianity doesn’t deal with. Not sure there’s much here that doesn’t speak to people who already have a Christian world-view and/or just need a little reassurance that the kingdom isn’t falling down.",5

"6046","Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II","Informative biography that adds depth to Audrey Hepburn","Maria-Anne","1732273537","R2KE42ZF6ZLOUY","1556287253","I was excited to see a biography that focused on Audrey Hepburn's early life and experiences relating to World War II. It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.

Audrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.

How World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.

Audrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.

I didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days. Like other reviews have mentioned, this biography isn't for low-key Audrey Hepburn fans. This doesn't focus on the glamorous side of her life. People interested in learning more about Audrey Hepburn's formative years will be satisfied, and leave with a deeper understanding of the actress.",5

The Ortho books, coupled with some Diana Kennedy classics constitute my Mexican collection and any new book has to be pretty special to compare well with these.

"6173","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","something horribly goes wrong","Amazon Customer","0062678426","R2PG1BI43J1MZC","1556297113","It isn't paranoia if it's really happening...The Woman in the Window is intoxicating, dark, and simply unputdownable. AJ Finn's debut novel is placed in current day, gentrified Harlem, New York City, where Dr. Anna Fox spends her day in her five-story townhouse drinking Merlot, spying on her neighbors, and mixing pills to numb her thoughts. She has theories and pseudo-storylines for her neighbors, each one being unique and different in their own way. When she is not photographing and spying on her neighbors, Anna watches famous black and white movies to pass the time and regularly checks in with her daughter and husband, who she recently has separated from. Anna suffers from agoraphobia, preventing her from leaving the confines of her house and limiting her ability to experience the real world effectively. Her hours, days, and weeks are consumed by fear and curiosity. When her new neighbors move in across the park from her house, Anna is intrigued at their anonymity. As she begins to investigate the story of her new neighbors, something horribly goes wrong. Anna witnesses something that shouldn't have happened—or did she?I won this ARC in a Goodreads giveaway and literally jumped out of my bed and yelled, ""YESSS!!!"" I immediately was drawn to the story because let's face it, spending time spying on your neighbors while drinking too much wine sounds like my Friday nights. I was curious to see how this story would develop and see what the hype was about. After getting hooked in right from the beginning, I figured out why. The Woman in the Window will definitely not be for everybody. The initial pacing is moderate, to say the least. I wouldn't classify it as a slow burn however, because as the story progresses, the character development of Anna and the provided characters becomes ever more intriguing. Nothing is rushed or overlooked—everything is portrayed at exactly the right time. Why is Anna agoraphobic? What's her mental state like? How is she coping? What's going on in the outside world that she's missing? Who are all these people around her? These are just some of the questions that pulled me in while starting The Woman in the Window and it kept me guessing until the end.The Woman in the Window breaks away from the mold of some of the more recent in-your-face psychological thrillers that have been sprouting out more and more since the release of the book that shall not be named, and that's very refreshing to me. This type of psychological thriller really gets you in the mindset of Anna's psyche without throwing everything at you at once.As I've stated earlier, this book will not be for everyone. This thriller breaks the mold and sets a new standard—so buckle up 2018!",5

Finn’s most talked about (highly anticipated) psychological thriller THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, most definitely lives up to the hype!  A B S O R B I N G.Just when you think you have attained your answers and you have reached the top of the mountain— think again. The climb has only begun. It is just gaining speed.  From here on out, it is non-stop action, suspense —unputdownable. There are many more twists to follow before reaching the explosive ending— making this an ""engrossing"" 5 stars “must read” and Top Thrillers of 2018.Audiobook Not sure I have ever been this immersed in an audiobook previously. Cannot stress enough, Ann Marie Lee (narrator) rocks! Her performance is award-winning. I was hanging on every word.  Generally, with audio, I am distracted by other work and continuously rewinding. Not the case with THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. BTW, I purchased the Kindle format, hardcover (which has not arrived from Amazon), and the audiobook.Anna, age 38 agoraphobic, cat owner, fond of wine drinking wine and pill popping to ease her fears. She likes old classic black-and-white movie classics — and she spies on her neighbors.“Everything goes down better with a glass of smooth merlot.”When Anna views the woman in the window: ""I noticed she liked a drink in the morning, as do I.""The narrator: again, off-the-charts bloody-good. The author: So many delicious witty one-liners.Anna is a child psychologist and often advises a few patients by email. “The doctor is in.”She does not venture into the outside world; however, she does have phone conversations with her husband (ex) and her eight-year-old daughter.Readers are unsure what happened to her family and why she is in this state. However, she is in constant contact with her husband and daughter even though they live apart. We suspect something dreadful, painful, and tragic occurred.She resides in a beautiful large home in Manhattan and has a handsome tenant, who is a carpenter. He lives in her basement. Her latest highlight a new form of entertainment happens to be her new neighbors. They do not seem to have any window dressing, and she enjoys observing. (spying). Trying to figure out their life from her eyes.Ethan Russell, the son (age sixteen) lives across the street. He is a pleasant enough young man, and Anna seems to connect with him. She also meets the parents: Paul and Jane (from the window).  Then one night, after watching her usual noir films, she witnesses a crime. She is frantic! She sees a woman murdered. She immediately calls the police.However, she is not a credible witness. After all, she comes across as crazy, paranoid, unstable. Pretty much an alcoholic buzzed out on pills, and an agoraphobic.  She is beyond puzzled and begins her own investigation. The wife is OK and alive, says the cops. However, the wife is not the one she saw that night. Therefore, Anna thinks she is an imposter.  However, what is the motive? What happened to the woman in the window?She immediately begins suspecting everyone. She becomes obsessed. Picking up clues any way she can. The also has a feeling Ethan is scared of his parents and offers him friendship. Cleverly, the author unravels the reasoning behind Anna becoming an alcoholic and an agoraphobic. However, again, this is NOT the end. Do not let your guard down. Keep your spy hat in place.Anna continues to watch her Hitchcockian movies (the titles relate to parts of her investigation) and speaks to her family. Slowly she begins suspecting she is not crazy like everyone thinks she is.  However, she needs to seek solid answers before she gets the police involved again. She must find clues and confront the problem. It is not paranoia or is it?The cops think with the constant viewing of late night crime movies, in combination with her alcohol and medication she sees things that are not there.  However, Anna is more than determined to find answers to prove to herself and everyone there is something more sinister at play. In doing so, then she may be able to face her demons to begin to live a somewhat healthy life.What a fantastic book!  Brilliantly written and plotted, psychologically rich, characters well-drawn, highly emotional —From love, loss, to complete madness. Anna is a woman you can sympathize with, no matter your gender or age. I listened/read in one sitting.Once you reach the 50-75% mark, you will understand why the movie rights. As mentioned in my review of  The Wives Between Us (coming Jan 9, 2018) , another huge hit 5 Stars ++ with film rights; why these two books will be on the bestseller list for some time to come: Readers are getting the “best” of the literary world (expertise) with the two author's background in journalism, and the publishing world, plus Pekkannen is a well established best-selling author. These guys know what they are doing and do it well. What a way to kick off 2018!Back to TWITW: I enjoyed the second half of the book, more than the first part. The first part is a slow-burning set up for the fast-paced, intense second half.  If you have read,The Ghostwriterby Alessandra Torre Top Books of 2017 you will note some similarities when reading between the lines of the main character. (both of course with different outcomes). Fans of each- will enjoy the other.Both involve an unreliable narrator, with a mystery surrounding husband and child, and agoraphobic. Ironically, A. J. Finn’s THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW also reminds me strongly of A. R. Torre (Alessandra Torre)’s Deanna Madden SeriesThe Girl in 6E (A Deanna Madden Novel Book 1)(minus the erotica, UPS man, and internet sex); however, the box cutter, agoraphobic, family tragic past, and a strong pull to save someone beyond the reaches of her home, while putting herself in harm’s way.Highly Recommend for fans of well-written strong, and intelligent psychological suspense thrillers. Heavy on the old movie classics, literary flair, and less on the blood and gore, which works for me. Enthralling, and all-consuming are words which quickly come to mind.  To summarize, Finn brilliantly explores the mind of Anna. Her anxiety, fears, insanity, depression, mental illness, paranoia, panic attacks, agoraphobia; love, loss, grief, and guilt —hitting all cylinders.The next Gone Girl? I would say ""Yes,"" to that question. Looking forward to the small/or big screen and can imagine its cast of stars. I loved Anna! I hope we see more of her in future books.  JDCMustReadBooks",5

In your head.I opened the book, read the first couple pages, laid on the floor, then proceeded to begin Adventure.My name was Aaron Doxal and I was seeking the Crystal of Kazal. The prince had been buried with it in his tomb. With the help of Hassan we traversed the trials and tribulations of the temple. We found Kazal Amek’s sarcophagus but sadly, too late. Lady Evelyn had gotten to it first. Her hubris was her downfall, for she had forgotten the writings on the scroll. “You enter through the eye, to get to the temple. I used Hassan’s family ring to lock in the inscription on the top of the casket. Through more puzzles I got the real crystal. I went back in time to kill the vile woman who ruined my life when I lived in the orphanage. I hadn’t thought it out all the way and ended up running into my previous self. We locked eyes, and I faded out of existence.This barely scratches the surface of what Adventure put me through. It guided me to really visualize and make the story real.

"6199","The Miracle Equation: The Two Decisions That Move Your Biggest Goals from Possible, to Probable, to  Inevitable","Don't Underestimate This Book!","Marc D. Ensign","1984823701","R37B0G75RGV79B","1556299611","(In the name of transparency, I've known the author Hal Elrod for years. Even though we've only met face to face once when we went out to dinner at some hole in the wall vegan restaurant in Orlando where I ordered something really gross by accident, I consider him a dear friend.)

(In the name of integrity, I would not leave a positive review for this book if I didn't actually like it. I would rather break Hal's heart and say no than write something I didn't believe with every cell in my body.)

The first thing that stuck out with me when I saw the subtitle which was ""The Two Things that Move Your Biggest Goals from Possible, to Probable, to Inevitable"" was the words ""Two Things."" That's when my inner cynic kicked in. ""Really? Two things and I have a first class ticket to Miracle Village?""

(That's a real place by the way. It's in Florida.)

The reason for the cynicism is that everyone is always promising some massive transformation with little effort nowadays and few (if any) really deliver on that promise. But this book is different.

First of all, one could argue that the author Hal Elrod has been through hell and back. Twice. And when I say ""and back"" I mean that he came back with a smile on his face.

Just like you wouldn't want to read a book about how to become a millionaire by someone who has never made a million dollars, you wouldn't want to read a book about how to create miracles by someone who has never created miracles. And Hal has two under his belt. He would argue a few more if you were to count his family.

So, as far as credible sources go, I don't know of anyone more qualified to write a book on miracles.

Second of all, the ""two things"" he talks about aren't as simple as ""brush your teeth and make your bed and POOF! Miracles!"" It's ""Unwavering Faith!"" and ""Extraordinary Effort!"" (The exclamation point was mine...I like to help Hal out wherever I can).

Unwavering is not easy. Extraordinary is not easy. This book is by no means a silver bullet or get out of jail free card. It requires work on your part. And so this book is PACKED (I hate that word, but it's the most relevant in this case) with wisdom and action and inspiration to help you get to a place where you can live into these two things...Unwavering Faith and Extraordinary Effort.

I'm not quite there yet. But having read this book, I am a million times closer and working towards it. I don't know of any other book that has inspired me to take action as aggressively and with as much confidence as The Miracle Equation.

If you've made it this far, you are clearly thinking about reading this book. For fear of sounding like a used car salesman or a cheerleader for Hal, get it. Of all of the books you could (and should) read right now, this one should be at the top of the list.",5

Unfortunately, I appeared to have missed one and I would have liked to have read it before this one.  I would like to have met Mark Scott and read his adventures with Maisie before tackling this one but I was able to keep up.The one thing that niggled me in this book was Maisie's preoccupation with what Scott, an American agent, was doing in London. He told her he was working for the president and it was top secret but she just wouldn't stop trying to find out what his mission was. You would think that she of all people would be more respectful of boundary lines, after all she has lots in her murder investigations. But the entire way through she obsesses on it and it got quite annoying and was completely out of character.Scott and Maisie are assigned a murder investigation of an American reporter, Catherine Saxon, the daughter of an isolationist Senator. Maisie and her best friend, Priscilla, are driving ambulances at night and Saxon actually rode with them to write a story the night she was murdered. Maisie is even more determined to solve the complex murder that has lots of twists and turns.There are lots of personal things going on with her. She is trying to adopt Anna, an orphan, she has been caring for awhile. She has a budding romance with Scott. Priscilla's family is trying to recover from numerous war injuries. Maisie helps both Billy and Sandra's families to her estate to be safer from the horrible bombing.  And, of course, there is Maisie's nonstop investigation into Scott's mission.This is not my favorite book in the series. It dragged for me and I really just wanted it done by the end. Have I read too many WWII books lately? Was the writing over long? Could the author use a spark of humor in her books to lighten it up occasionally ? Yes to all of the above.",4

Definitely not! It's more pathetic than funny. Yes, it identifies Trump's pathological lying attitude comparing his obsessive need to win at all costs to the game of golf that should be the epitome of an honorable game. Thing is the book is repetitive & I found it tough to read the entire book because it cites the same old/same old on every page. Trump lies, steals, misrepresents,cheats again & again & doesn't care one iota and keeps dishing out his dirt regardless if you are a VIP, celebrity or know nothing. He's obsessed with winning and holds no value in integrity much less the honor of the game. This book is great with massive detail and uses umpteen facts and figures to prove the argument that Trump is crooked, doesn't care who knows it and will go to all ends to cheat his way to the top. He's king and scoffs at any suggestion he's not. Using the game of golf to metaphor his methods underscores how horrible this particular man is. There's no humanity in the individual much less expertise. I had hoped I'd laugh my way thru the descriptions & was hoping for hilarity as Chris Matthews suggested but instead I was saddened at how despicable Trump is. He cheapens the game of golf and I marvel at how many go along with his attitude and don't seem to care. Shame on them! Shame on anyone who looks the other way whenever Trump is around because this is his method whether it's golf, governing or acting like he cares about anything but himself.",4

Then Newton (1643-1727) and Leibniz (1646-1716) invented a mathematical tool to get closer and closer to the changing system at hand. Steven did a great job explaining how Calculus uses divide-and-conquer to the extreme taming infinity to describe the universe. It changed civilization; this book travels from Archimedes (-212) computing pi to today’s design of airplanes. And Calculus is still evolving like a living organism after an explosion of diversity to explain CHANGE. For example, Einstein (1879-1955) used Calculus to play with space (say x, y, z) and time, at least four things changing at the same time.",5

The fresh start in Maine appears to be the change Creed yearns for.  A bad relationship with his father-in-law, the redoubtable Irwin Goldman and soured on city living, Maine appears to be the answer to his questions.Set in 1983-1984, Creed appears to be the picture of the 1980s YUPPIE (Young Urban Professional).  Established in his career with the ability to relocate also point up to this very positive, professional image.Each character is drawn with realistic words; each character becomes vivid and believable, again evidence of a master storyteller.  My favorite part in this book was Creed's ""last happy day, 3/24/84,"" the day he spent flying kites with Gage, then just 2.Once settled in Maine, life and death appear to shift and the line dividing the two becomes blurry and indistinct, thanks to King's superb storytelling.  A graveyard for pets dating back to the early 20th Century is near the Creed home and a very chilling secret lurks there.Death appears to lurk in every corner of the small town.  First, the Creed cat is killed by a truck on the truck infested roadway near their home.  Gage is killed in May of 1984 after he darts away from Creed and into the path of an oncoming truck.  Rachel describes the agonizing death of her older sister Zelda in 1965 when Zelda was 10 and Rachel 8.  Rachel's fear of death causes her to lash out at Creed when he gently explains the death of the cat to Ellie; she refuses to attend a neighbor's funeral and barely gets through Gage's.Creed uncovers the mystery of the Pet Sematary (so spelled by local children who have buried their pets there) and uses what he has learned to make the dividing line between life and death questionable and indistinct.This is one of King's best stories!",5

The additional tools, templates, and exercises throughout the book's chapters are incredibly helpful for actually putting these ideas into practice. One of my biggest pitfalls in reading and learning is that I'm presented with amazing ideas, but then I struggle to actually practice them in a way that transforms my life.

Granted, I am a fan of his career even though I have often disagreed with him. He is one of the great minds of the century, much like the incredible Charles Krauthammer. Both put their love of the Constitution and their personal values ahead of their politics. Mr Dershowitz is a liberal and a Hillary supporter, but based his introduction on the law He is a longtime law professor at Harvard. So very odd that people have found his introduction to be biased towards Trump when it is all about the law. Guess people are so blinded by their obsessive hatred of Trump that the law no longer matters to them or they are just trying to skew the reviews. If you are interested in a fair legal analysis of the report, this book is for you. Alan Dershowitz doesn’t let his personal politics spin the law. The Mueller Report will put you to sleep, however.
As an aside, it will be a sad day when people are so intolerant of differing views that great conversations will be silenced. Ignore the petty, intolerant reviews that aim to silence the conversations from biased people on all sides. Just ridiculous!

She did so without a paycheck and worked strictly off heart.  I would highly recommend reading ""Sudden Terror"" by Larry Crompton (the original detective on the case. it can be crude but to the point, and you feel the cop banter yet feel the care and worry in his writing).  I also suggest East area Rapist/Golden State Killer by Kat Winters to get more details about actual attacks and methods he used.  Sudden Terror is more witness and detective oriented with info on crimes, the other is more crime fact based where you are to draw your own conclusions.  I think they are a must read together and possibly before you read this book!  The recommended books dive more into the crimes where Michelle goes more into the man.  She does briefly go over some things the killer was known for, but we know she died well before her time and before her beloved book was finished which is why I think you need the other books for companion pieces if you want a larger scope of this illusive heartless killer.

Now I know why some things happened. You know those things, the little things that are only in the head, written in the book, but doesn't show up in the movie part. Wow!

Refreshing to find a writer who can grab the reader from page one.  Gorgeously written, fast, smooth, confident prose that never loses pace, momentum or interest.  This reader was hooked immediately by the genuinely interesting characters and a unique premise.  The book is stunning, intelligent, psychologically astute and deliciously dark. It is a deeply atmospheric story drenched in anxiety, fear and relentless foreboding.  Finn’s Anna is an empathetic child psychologist who grapples with her own issues of agoraphobia, loneliness and a penchant for observing her neighbors lives, while safely behind the windows of her four-story home.  Surprisingly, Anna is instantly likable, despite flirting with alcoholism, recklessness with medications and her increasing voyeurism.  She spends  her days with the comfort of old movies, online chess and counseling other agoraphobics via the internet.  Unexpectedly, her reclusive existence isn’t dull or claustrophobic for the reader.  The reader is lulled into the rhythm and solitude of Anna’s routine.  She drinks, thinks, prowls the house and watches the world go by from afar, protected by a pane of glass or a camera lens.  Then one day, she witnesses something that no one else sees.  Authorities and friends are openly skeptical, attributing it to her solo environment and her burgeoning fragile state.  She begins to doubt her own perceptions as her mind skitters and unravels, as she struggles to hold on to reality.  There is the obvious homage to Rear Window and Gaslight here, which is an added bonus.  If you like great writing, Hitchcockian drama, classic films and a book you can’t put down, this one does not disappoint.  Highly recommended.  Thoroughly enjoyable, first-rate entertainment.  Looking forward to more books from Finn.  Will read anything he writes!",5

I found a lot of things in it that I was able to highlight but I did also disagree with a lot. In Girl Stop Apologizing, I found even less. In my opinion Rachel Hollis comes across as a snob. In one point in the book she talks about how her mother (who was a single mom at the time) threw her a party and she was ashamed of it and never wanted to be that way as a mom. For someone who was raised by a single mother that often struggled financially, I was extremely upset by this. She comes across as entitled and privileged. I understand that Rachel did struggle growing up, but I don't understand how she is saying she grew through her struggles - instead it looks like she ran from them instead of facing them head on.I wanted to like this book. I really NEEDED to like this book and wanted to use it and be able to apply it to my own life. Instead I was left disappointed and struggled to finish the book.",2

He lives his life out in a tiny attic room far from the glamour and wealth with which he was formally accustomed, but this gentleman doesn't let this get to him in any way. Instead, he uses this time with great aplomb and his wisdom,grace and insatiable curiosity will charm even the most discerning reader.He leads life to the full with a full bevy of loves and acquaintances and the ending is deeply satisfying.Of course the story deviates hugely from the probabilities of that time but A Gentleman in Moscow is a work of fiction and as such a wonderful literary experience.The book flagged a little through the middle but the wonderful writing overcomes this to a large degree.I have already recommended this lovely book.",5

The other example is what's in this publication and what's not being reported or underrepresented by the same MSM and other reviews of this document.

""With all the distractions of terror and war, few Americans realize that in 2002, a Congressional Joint Inquiry was formed to investigate the 9/11 attack. The investigation was an unprecedented act by the U.S. congress. Never before had the two permanent intelligence oversight committees, one from the House and One from the Senate, collaborated on an investigation.""

You can find the Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 (Volume One) presenting factual information in that report by clicking on my profile.

Additional material from people who work the mass media platforms presenting first hand eye witness accounts reporting they can't tell you the truth can be found in the publication, Into The Buzzsaw: LEADING JOURNALISTS EXPOSE THE MYTH OF A FREE PRESS by clicking on my profile.

Although I think this fake investigation ""authorized"" by Rod Rosenstein who also happen to approve one of the fake FISA warrants and THEN recommend to the POTUS to fire Comey trying to black mail the POTUS, was the same Rosenstein who authorized Robert Mueller to cover up the coup attempt after Comey was fired for his misconduct is just insane that it all really happened, I have obtained this publication and wanted to share some key points it seems most are forgetting all while looking for red meat to validate this coup attempt.

Kindle section 605 reports the investigation did not establish the members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.

Kindle section 637 notes the investigation applied the term, “coordination” in that report did not establish the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.

Kindle section 651 again notes the investigation did not find any evidence any U.S. personal conspired or coordinated with the IRA.

Kindle section 680 repeats that the investigation did not find any member of the Trump campaign [conspired] or coordinated with the Russian Government in its attempt mess up the 2016 election.

Kindle section 783 notes that ""...while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks’s releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.""

Kindle section 783 references George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty of lying to investigators “about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud,…” however, Judge Moss who rendered the two weeks in jail for Mr. Papadopoulos noted, “I don’t have any reason to believe and I don’t think there’s any reason in the record to conclude that Mr. Papadopoulos had any desire to aid Russia in any way, to do anything that was contrary to the national interest.”

Kindle section 797 notes the Mueller investigation did not find that any “official’s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also pointed out that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at Sessions’s Senate office was nothing ""more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign.”

Kindle section 3996 notes again the Mueller investigation did not find any evidence the “Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.""

Once again, Kindle section 4161 notes the evidence was not sufficient to charge anyone connected to the Trump Campaign acted as an “agent of a foreign principal within the meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government of Russia, or any official thereof” Specifically, the investigation found no “evidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian government-or at its direction, control, or request-during the relevant time period.""

Kindle section 9778 references there was no evidence to show the POTUS was involved in an “underlying crime related to Russian election interference.""

Finally, Kindle section 10398, notes to vol II: notes “8. presents ""As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.”

There's more but I think my point has been reasonably presented in that it's been a coup attempt in our nation to cover up the real crime by the leadership of various Intel orgs in this nation as the POTUS and the rest of America are the victims.

"6582","Mama's Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What…","He Compares Primate and Human Behavior Most Beautifully","Stephanie De Pue","0393635066","R14YAZTZ07CXPM","1556388048","Mama's Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What They Tell Us about Ourselves 1st Edition, by primatologist Frans de Waal, a New York Times bestseller, who here explores the world of human and animal emotions.  The Dutch-born de Waal has been named one of Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People. The author of Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, among many other works, he is the C. H. Candler Professor in Atlanta, Georgia’s Emory University’s Psychology Department and director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center.The primatologist  has spent four decades at the forefront of animal research. Following up on the best-selling Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, which investigated animal intelligence, Mama’s Last Hug delivers an extraordinary accounting  of the rich emotional lives of animals.Mama’s Last Hug begins with the death of Mama, a 59-year old chimpanzee matriarch who ruled her followers with an iron hand and formed a deep bond with biologist Jan van Hooff. When Mama was dying, van Hooff took the unusual step of visiting her in her night cage for a last hug. Their goodbyes were filmed and went viral. Millions of people were deeply moved by the way Mama embraced the professor, welcoming him with a big smile while reassuring him by patting his neck, in a gesture often considered typically human but that is in fact common to all primates. This story and others like it form the core of de Waal’s argument, showing that humans are not the only species with the capacity for love, hate, fear, shame, guilt, joy, disgust, empathy, and a sense of fairness. De Waal discusses facial expressions, the emotions behind human politics, the illusion of free will, animal sentience, and, of course, Mama’s life and death. The message is one of continuity between us and other species, such as the radical proposal that emotions are like organs: we don’t have a single organ that other animals don’t have, and the same is true for our emotions. De Waal is also a good storyteller.  As he tells the story of Kuif, a chimpanzee female, one of Mama’s oldest friends, who lost every baby she had because she was unable to make enough milk.  De Waal gave her an orphaned female infant, Rooseje, and showed Kuif how to bottle feed her.  Rooseje survived, and so did Kuif’s later infants, whom she bottle fed, as she had been taught.The author’s discussion of the animal concept of fairness was also particularly interesting, and buttressed with examples of many animal species. On this topic, I can add a recent experience of my own.  I have two cats, Divo, the elder, and Marco, a darling little boy. When I adopted Marco from the pound, I was told that for each meal they gave him a teaspoon full of wet food in addition to kibble.  I have followed this protocol. But recently, as Marco is such a cutie, I began letting him lick the spoon in which I gave him his wet food. Divo objected violently, verbally, and by knocking against the hand giving Marco his special treat.  After all, not only was Divo missing out on a special treat, his meal was being delayed by the time the spoon licking took.  Couldn’t figure out what to do, til I finally tried giving Divo some of his kibble while Marco was licking the spoon. Divo accepted that as fair.  Problem solved. So don’t tell me cats don’t have emotions.Let me allow de Waal to give his own autobiography.” I am a Dutch/American biologist, born in the Netherlands in 1948, having lived in the USA since 1981. My passion is primate behavior, and the comparison between primate and human behavior. I pursue the first as a scientist and the second as a writer of popular books. For me, there is nothing more logical than to look at human society through the lens of animal behavior.I have a Ph. D. in zoology and ethology (the study of animal behavior) from the University of Utrecht, and now teach Psychology at Emory University, in Atlanta. My first book, ""Chimpanzee Politics,"" compared the schmoozing and scheming of chimpanzees involved in power struggles with that of human politicians. The book even reached the reading list of the congress in Washington. Ever since, I have drawn parallels between primate and human behavior, from aggression to morality and culture.”Now, mind you, I am no Hollywood starlet who “loves animals.” And I acknowledge Tennyson’s line that “nature is red in tooth and claw. “ Yes, there are prey animals that live by hunting. Still, I believe animals were made by the same forces that made humans, and that they deserve decent, humane lives and considerate slaughter.  In a world where billions of animals annually are forced to lead horrendous factory farm lives, and suffer terrifying slaughter. So I surely loved, loved, loved this book.",5

"6605","Pet Sematary: A Novel","I've read a great deal of Stephen King in my life","M. Burrows","198211598X","R1RQKVHYWN683Y","1556446264","I've read a great deal of Stephen King in my life, but for some reason this is one I missed. This was one of his early novels. I believe the first book of King's I read was The Stand and this one came out before that one. Also at some point I saw the movie with Jack Nicholson, so just never got around to the book until now. Recently however I was given a copy of ""Doctor Sleep"" which is a continuation of the main character in ""The Shining"", so I thought it would be good to read ""The Shining"" before getting into that one. I'm glad I did. ""The Shining"" is classic Stephen King. Even though this is one of his earlier books, I think the writing is just as good as it is now, however in later years King seems to have gotten away from straight supernatural horror type stories, like the Shining and has gotten more into stories that may have an element of the supernatural in them as a set up to the story, but are really more about the characters and the human interactions, like ""Under the Dome"", ""11/22/63"" and most recently ""Mr Mercedes"", which really had no supernatural elements in it at all. However, even though ""The Shining"" was much more of the supernatural, horror type story, the human element was still a key component to the book. King's ability to write about believable characters that really come to life and combine that with unexplained and frightening events is what makes King such a good writer, and one who has stood the test of time. ""The Shining"" is one of those books that stands up to the passing of the years, and is well worth the read, if you missed it like I did. Now I think I'll look at the film again and see how it compares.",4

Mr. Reilly finds just the right balance between explaining enough about golf to make the many, many ways Trump cheats clear, and not straying too far from the point of the book. He uses a lot of jargon, but I never really found it unclear.
What's really delightful is Mr. Reilly's prose. He has a wicked turn of phrase, and illustrates his points with clever references.
All in all, this was...not a joy to read, because this buffoon is out president, but it was certainly engaging and revelatory.",4

"6614","Pet Sematary: A Novel","agonizingly monotone","Laura Henri","198211598X","R2XVKHYCLLGDX9","1556447145","This is a review on the Audio book, The Shining, read by Campbell Scott.I love The Shining, its one of the best haunted house, er, hotel stories ever written. The movie was amazing as well, but lacked the in depth characterization that the book offers. To read The Shining, you get an insight into Jacks history, his reason for being jobless, the family connection, Danny's inner turmoil, the Outlooks History. I got the audio book to have at work, and was disappointed. To tell this story, from Jack, Danny's, and Wendy's point of view, and to really put to voice the terror, heartache and confusion King has in the book, you need someone who can relay that emotion and Campbell doesn't do it for me. He is too staccato in his pronunciation of words, too monotone at parts that are supposed to be read with agony, too breathy with his female voice. I found myself tuning him out because he was so boring, that I missed parts of the book and had to rewind.  This book is terrifying, campbell makes it just moderatly creepy.This same thing happened when I got ""The Cell"" on audiobook, Campbell also reads that one. If you love this book like I do, don't buy this, you will be disappointed with it.",1

"6621","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Review of Stephen King's The Shining","Annie Kentris","198211598X","RYZJPYWUDVDA4","1556447867","This is, as incredible as it sounds, the first Stephen King book I've ever read. I would like to start by saying that it is indeed scary, and an enjoyable read. Reading this book for a prestigious literary course, I had to put all stereotypes aside, that a thriller can't be worthy of literary praise, that a cover the screams #1 bestseller isn't going to have any literary worth when I read the book, as my teacher assured us that Stephen King does know a think or two about literary conventions. Theme, worldviews, and characterization-it's all in there.In fact this novel is written in the five-act Shakespearian structure; exposition, inciting incident, rising action, crisis moment, and falling action/ resolution. In a thriller book, this is the only logical way to present the thrill. However, I admit that I felt the book should've been shorter, mostly because I felt like I knew the ending from the beginning (and I've never seen the movie). The prose seemed simple; so simple sometimes I felt almost as though King wasn't granting any credit to the readers.The overall thematic intent of the book seemed muffled. At first I thought it was somewhat of a ghost story, but then it seemed as if the alcoholism that Jack suffered from took over with the dramatics, then back to the ghosts of the Overlook hotel. All the while both, not to mention the psychic encounters his son Danny faces or a talent King calls ""shine"", are destroying the family. In the beginning there is a definite distinction between the Torrence family competing against the Overlook hotel, which are equally corrupt. Then Jack is removed from the family because the hotel spirit has defeated him personally because he was the easiest target, corrupt past, drinking problem, bad tempter etc.  These issues were explained in the beginning exposition, or act one, so it seemed to spoil a potential suspense for later in the novel.  So then with Jack under the control of the hotel evil, it is obvious that Wendy and Danny aren't equally capable of defeating this opposition on their own. Very predictably, a character reappears to save the day.One very important dramatic decision King made was establishing a past for the rivals. This is where the theme of history repeating itself is introduced. Knowing that it is cyclical in nature the reader waits to see if either opposing force can defeat it's own history. The lesson to be learned here is that if you aren't informed, history will repeat itself; hence the ""overlook"" name. Those who violate those laws of nature are punished in the end. Luckily, so the ending being in agreement with every reader's expectations saves the overall worldview.Another disappointment for me was the falling action. As I said, I felt I knew what was going to happen so perhaps it took away from the suspense. The material was well put together in the beginning, very scary, and well positioned. However it seemed that in the progression of the five acts, the end fizzled, it didn't explode. And with a book of that potential all through the beginning and middle parts, it needs to go out with a bang!",4
