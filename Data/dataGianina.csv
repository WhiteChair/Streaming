It releases today - and it is sooooooo good! Honestly, every time I finish one of Coben's books, I think 'oh, that's the best one yet.' This latest? Settle in for the day when you start to read - it's impossible to put down!Oh, and did I mention that I have a copy to giveaway, courtesy of Grand Central Publishing?!!  Nobody writes 'everyday guy in a bad situation' books better than Coben. In this latest, Simon's drug addicted daughter Paige has run away with her abusive boyfriend. Simon has been looking for her for months. Then one day, sitting on a bench in Central Park, he spies her playing the guitar for spare change. He approaches her, but she runs again. And Simon follows.....Cut to a new set of characters - Ash and DeeDee - a pair of stone cold killers. (\"Murder was simple if you kept it simple.\") And one more player, Elena, a private investigator looking for a missing man. How are these stories all going to tie together? And that dear reader, is the beauty of Harlan Coben's books. There's no predicting where the story is going to go. The plot of Run Away is an intricate jigsaw of a plot - until that last piece is slotted in, you can't be sure there's not another turn in the story. (And there are many - that last one is a doozy.)The reader is privy to all three narratives and is aware of what each set of characters are up to. Which only serves to ratchet up the tension even more. The cliffhangers at the end of each chapter are dangerous - I couldn't stop reading 'just one more chapter'. I had to know what would happen next.Each character has their own story and they are really well drawn and fleshed out. Simon's anguish over his daughter is palpable. Elena's own personal story will resonate with you. And oddly enough, Ash has real feelings, despite his choice of profession.Whew! What a ride! Absolutely recommended!", "review_score": "5"}

There is NO shortage of this kind of material on the market. There is an endless supply of conferences, books, blogs, apps, TED Talks etc. In fact, this segment is so oversaturated that it sometimes seems too overwhelming and complex to know where to begin or whose \"method\" to follow. I will be up front and state that I am a \"seeker\" looking for sanity amidst the deluge of tasks and activities coming at me from all manner of inputs whilst fighting my own proclivities of procrastination and distraction. Rather than giving up and assuming the battle lost and hopeless, I began a seemingly endless journey of finding the proverbial silver bullet. Let me save you the time; it doesn't exist. What DOES exist are resources like Michael Hyatt\u2019s Free to Focus.\n\nIf you enjoy or practice GTD, this is the missing piece that makes it achievable. Like Lean methodology? This takes those principles and personalizes them. Breaking things down into three basic steps (Stop, Cut, Act), Mr. Hyatt proceeds to lay out an accessible, digestible, and measurable way to approach what you need to do. I have appreciated working through the online course and will enjoy the opportunity to now carry it with me so that as I work to learn and apply it, I will have this reference along the way. This is, for me, not unlike getting physically fit. I will have to continuously train, practice, and grow for the results to stick. At least he makes this fun.\n\nNot ready to dive in? No worries. Take his Personal Productivity Assessment (available on the Free to Focus website) and at least consider what it may do to aid you. He does also have other resources and tools to check out before investing in this or any of his products or \u201csystems.\u201d I would encourage you to do your due diligence but I, for one, think I may have found the thing that will come alongside me and allow me to work through that which has always most hindered my productivity; myself.", "review_score": "5"}

I'm so glad the author decided to write a book about her because she's a fascinating character. Really liked this one as it had a little bit of everything including romance, espionage, and family drama. While this book could be read as standalone novel, I highly recommend checking out the previous book so you can get a better understanding of not just Beatriz but also her family and everything that took place in Cuba.\n\nIt's the 1960s and Beatriz and the Perez family are living in Florida after the Cuban Revolution forced them to leave everything behind in Cuba. Beatriz has a lot of anger towards the man responsible for all of the turmoil in her home country, Fidel Castro, and so she agrees to work as a spy for the CIA and infiltrate Castro's inner circle. She soon gets quite an education on the dirty side of politics for both countries and also manages to get caught up in a forbidden love affair. It's fair to say she will be forced to make a lot of tough choices, some with lasting consequences.\n\nI was slightly worried before reading this that it was going to read too much like a spy novel, which isn't really my thing. However, while Beatriz working for the CIA is definitely part of the story, there are other facets of her life that are explored as well. Overall there really was a nice balance to the story. I was drawn the most to Beatriz and her love life but I also enjoyed learning some of the historical facts regarding what was going on between Cuba and the United States during this time. It was also nice to revisit characters from the previous book.\n\nDefinitely an enjoyable read and I would love to see the author continue on with featuring Perez family members in future books.\n\nThank you to First to Read for the free advance digital copy! I was under no obligation to post a review and all views expressed are my honest opinion.", "review_score": "4"}

The other example is what's in this publication and what's not being reported or underrepresented by the same MSM and other reviews of this document.\n\n\"With all the distractions of terror and war, few Americans realize that in 2002, a Congressional Joint Inquiry was formed to investigate the 9/11 attack. The investigation was an unprecedented act by the U.S. congress. Never before had the two permanent intelligence oversight committees, one from the House and One from the Senate, collaborated on an investigation.\"\n\nYou can find the Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 (Volume One) presenting factual information in that report by clicking on my profile.\n\nAdditional material from people who work the mass media platforms presenting first hand eye witness accounts reporting they can't tell you the truth can be found in the publication, Into The Buzzsaw: LEADING JOURNALISTS EXPOSE THE MYTH OF A FREE PRESS by clicking on my profile.\n\nAlthough I think this fake investigation \"authorized\" by Rod Rosenstein who also happen to approve one of the fake FISA warrants and THEN recommend to the POTUS to fire Comey trying to black mail the POTUS, was the same Rosenstein who authorized Robert Mueller to cover up the coup attempt after Comey was fired for his misconduct is just insane that it all really happened, I have obtained this publication and wanted to share some key points it seems most are forgetting all while looking for red meat to validate this coup attempt.\n\nKindle section 605 reports the investigation did not establish the members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\n\nKindle section 637 notes the investigation applied the term, \u201ccoordination\u201d in that report did not establish the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\n\nKindle section 651 again notes the investigation did not find any evidence any U.S. personal conspired or coordinated with the IRA.\n\nKindle section 680 repeats that the investigation did not find any member of the Trump campaign [conspired] or coordinated with the Russian Government in its attempt mess up the 2016 election.\n\nKindle section 783 notes that \"...while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks\u2019s releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.\"\n\nKindle section 783 references George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty of lying to investigators \u201cabout, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud,\u2026\u201d however, Judge Moss who rendered the two weeks in jail for Mr. Papadopoulos noted, \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to believe and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason in the record to conclude that Mr. Papadopoulos had any desire to aid Russia in any way, to do anything that was contrary to the national interest.\u201d\n\nKindle section 797 notes the Mueller investigation did not find that any \u201cofficial\u2019s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also pointed out that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at Sessions\u2019s Senate office was nothing \"more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nKindle section 3996 notes again the Mueller investigation did not find any evidence the \u201cCampaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\"\n\nOnce again, Kindle section 4161 notes the evidence was not sufficient to charge anyone connected to the Trump Campaign acted as an \u201cagent of a foreign principal within the meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government of Russia, or any official thereof\u201d Specifically, the investigation found no \u201cevidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian government-or at its direction, control, or request-during the relevant time period.\"\n\nKindle section 9778 references there was no evidence to show the POTUS was involved in an \u201cunderlying crime related to Russian election interference.\"\n\nFinally, Kindle section 10398, notes to vol II: notes \u201c8. presents \"As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThere's more but I think my point has been reasonably presented in that it's been a coup attempt in our nation to cover up the real crime by the leadership of various Intel orgs in this nation as the POTUS and the rest of America are the victims.\n\nAdditional documents from my government presenting my observations has a historical justification can be found here:\n\nDOJ OIG REPORT INTO CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION: DOJ OIG RELEASES REPORT ON VARIOUS ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN ADVANCE OF THE 2016 ELECTION\n\nThe FBI, COINTELPRO, And Martin Luther King, Jr.: Final Report Of The Select Committee To Study Governmental Operations With Respect To Intelligence Activities\n\n1963 JFK Assassination: Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board - President John F.

There is NO shortage of this kind of material on the market. There is an endless supply of conferences, books, blogs, apps, TED Talks etc. In fact, this segment is so oversaturated that it sometimes seems too overwhelming and complex to know where to begin or whose \"method\" to follow. I will be up front and state that I am a \"seeker\" looking for sanity amidst the deluge of tasks and activities coming at me from all manner of inputs whilst fighting my own proclivities of procrastination and distraction. Rather than giving up and assuming the battle lost and hopeless, I began a seemingly endless journey of finding the proverbial silver bullet. Let me save you the time; it doesn't exist. What DOES exist are resources like Michael Hyatt\u2019s Free to Focus.\n\nIf you enjoy or practice GTD, this is the missing piece that makes it achievable. Like Lean methodology? This takes those principles and personalizes them. Breaking things down into three basic steps (Stop, Cut, Act), Mr. Hyatt proceeds to lay out an accessible, digestible, and measurable way to approach what you need to do. I have appreciated working through the online course and will enjoy the opportunity to now carry it with me so that as I work to learn and apply it, I will have this reference along the way. This is, for me, not unlike getting physically fit. I will have to continuously train, practice, and grow for the results to stick. At least he makes this fun.\n\nNot ready to dive in? No worries. Take his Personal Productivity Assessment (available on the Free to Focus website) and at least consider what it may do to aid you. He does also have other resources and tools to check out before investing in this or any of his products or \u201csystems.\u201d I would encourage you to do your due diligence but I, for one, think I may have found the thing that will come alongside me and allow me to work through that which has always most hindered my productivity; myself.", "review_score": "5"}

The other example is what's in this publication and what's not being reported or underrepresented by the same MSM and other reviews of this document.\n\n\"With all the distractions of terror and war, few Americans realize that in 2002, a Congressional Joint Inquiry was formed to investigate the 9/11 attack. The investigation was an unprecedented act by the U.S. congress. Never before had the two permanent intelligence oversight committees, one from the House and One from the Senate, collaborated on an investigation.\"\n\nYou can find the Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 (Volume One) presenting factual information in that report by clicking on my profile.\n\nAdditional material from people who work the mass media platforms presenting first hand eye witness accounts reporting they can't tell you the truth can be found in the publication, Into The Buzzsaw: LEADING JOURNALISTS EXPOSE THE MYTH OF A FREE PRESS by clicking on my profile.\n\nAlthough I think this fake investigation \"authorized\" by Rod Rosenstein who also happen to approve one of the fake FISA warrants and THEN recommend to the POTUS to fire Comey trying to black mail the POTUS, was the same Rosenstein who authorized Robert Mueller to cover up the coup attempt after Comey was fired for his misconduct is just insane that it all really happened, I have obtained this publication and wanted to share some key points it seems most are forgetting all while looking for red meat to validate this coup attempt.\n\nKindle section 605 reports the investigation did not establish the members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\n\nKindle section 637 notes the investigation applied the term, \u201ccoordination\u201d in that report did not establish the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\n\nKindle section 651 again notes the investigation did not find any evidence any U.S. personal conspired or coordinated with the IRA.\n\nKindle section 680 repeats that the investigation did not find any member of the Trump campaign [conspired] or coordinated with the Russian Government in its attempt mess up the 2016 election.\n\nKindle section 783 notes that \"...while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks\u2019s releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.\"\n\nKindle section 783 references George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty of lying to investigators \u201cabout, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud,\u2026\u201d however, Judge Moss who rendered the two weeks in jail for Mr. Papadopoulos noted, \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to believe and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason in the record to conclude that Mr. Papadopoulos had any desire to aid Russia in any way, to do anything that was contrary to the national interest.\u201d\n\nKindle section 797 notes the Mueller investigation did not find that any \u201cofficial\u2019s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also pointed out that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at Sessions\u2019s Senate office was nothing \"more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nKindle section 3996 notes again the Mueller investigation did not find any evidence the \u201cCampaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\"\n\nOnce again, Kindle section 4161 notes the evidence was not sufficient to charge anyone connected to the Trump Campaign acted as an \u201cagent of a foreign principal within the meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government of Russia, or any official thereof\u201d Specifically, the investigation found no \u201cevidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian government-or at its direction, control, or request-during the relevant time period.\"\n\nKindle section 9778 references there was no evidence to show the POTUS was involved in an \u201cunderlying crime related to Russian election interference.\"\n\nFinally, Kindle section 10398, notes to vol II: notes \u201c8. presents \"As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThere's more but I think my point has been reasonably presented in that it's been a coup attempt in our nation to cover up the real crime by the leadership of various Intel orgs in this nation as the POTUS and the rest of America are the victims.\n\nAdditional documents from my government presenting my observations has a historical justification can be found here:\n\nDOJ OIG REPORT INTO CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION: DOJ OIG RELEASES REPORT ON VARIOUS ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN ADVANCE OF THE 2016 ELECTION\n\nThe FBI, COINTELPRO, And Martin Luther King, Jr.: Final Report Of The Select Committee To Study Governmental Operations With Respect To Intelligence Activities\n\n1963 JFK Assassination: Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board - President John F.

{"book_title": "Master & Apprentice (Star Wars)", "review_title": "A Fun and Rewarding Journey", "review_user": "Skuldren", "book_id": "0525619372", "review_id": "R2QPIZRGQCQG8B", "timestamp": 1556369287, "review_text": "It\u2019s amazing to think that after all these years, and hundreds of Star Wars books, Qui-Gon Jinn has remained a mysterious and unexplored character. Aside from Jude Watson\u2019s young reader series Jedi Apprentice (which came out 17 years ago, is now Legends, and is out of print), there have been very few stories exploring this captivating Jedi who we first saw in The Phantom Menace. Beyond that film, our knowledge of the character is very limited. We know he was an apprentice to Count Dooku, and that he was the master of Obi-Wan Kenobi. But who was this mysterious Jedi master, one quick to believe in Jedi prophecies of a chosen one, one who Dooku teased would have joined him and the Separatists if he were still alive, and ultimately the one who taught Master Yoda how to become one with the Force? Finally we have a book that begins that exploration of the character. Master & Apprentice not only yields a better understanding of Qui-Gon, but also Obi-Wan, the Jedi prophecies, the Jedi council, and Count Dooku himself. On top of all that, it\u2019s a great read with enjoyable characters and entertaining plot. It\u2019s hard to ask for more.\n\nSet around seven years prior to The Phantom Menace, this book explores the relationship between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan as they set upon a mission to a far off world that will define the destinies before them. There is a queen coming to power on a planet called Pijal and a representative of the Republic is needed to oversee a treaty that will open up this area of space to an important hyperspace corridor. If all goes well, it will mean much needed supplies and resources for isolated worlds. But of course there are complications. Apparently not everyone is happy about the upcoming events, and an opposition movement presents problems that the Jedi will have to investigate. Things get more complicated and messier from there as the tension builds and the plot unfurls. Without spoiling anything, it provides an enjoyable backbone that drives the story along.\n\nAdding to the main story is a series of subplots which are just as interesting and enticing. One of the biggest underlying themes that is explored is that of slavery. Going to Pijal, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan come face to face with it and have to reconcile how such a practice can exist and why the Jedi have not done more to combat it. Some of the new characters introduced in the book get woven into the slavery plot, and it becomes a very compelling element to the story. Not only is it a good story point in itself, but it builds upon the greater story of Star Wars and Anakin Skywalker\u2019s position as a slave. Beyond that, the book explores the Jedi prophecies and the Jedi mystics. It establishes Qui-Gon\u2019s interest in them, how that came to be, why they are somewhat taboo in the Jedi Order, and how they become so important to Qui-Gon going forward. Again, it\u2019s a very interesting element to the story and it adds to the greater picture as it ties-in with the films and animated series. The exploration of those prophecies also leads to the exploration of Dooku.\n\nWhile the cover of the book features Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, the title embraces much more than just those two. We get a deep look at Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan\u2019s relationship, which is nowhere near as smooth as I thought it would be. The friction between the two is actually a wonderful surprise as it adds to the tension in the book. Through this adventure, we see where that relationship could have gone, and where it ultimately heads. But beyond them, we also get a glimpse of Dooku and Qui-Gon as master and apprentice, which is so tantalizing delicious. There are passages threaded throughout the story that provides a peek into the past and show us moments of what their apprenticeship was like. We gain insight at how Qui-Gon looked at Dooku, and insight on just who Dooku was as a Jedi, and the clues of his fall. Plus we learn of another apprentice Dooku had which helps shed more light on this mysterious character who chose to leave the order and become a Sith.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say too much without giving away the plot or spoiling anything, but it\u2019s certainly worth the effort. Master & Apprentice is a great read that offers enjoyment on many levels for Star Wars fans. It\u2019s a wonderful exploration of the characters, the Force, Jedi, philosophy, and finding one\u2019s purpose in life. It\u2019s both a fun journey and a rewarding one as you learn more about the greater story of Star Wars, and the personal journey within this one. I give it a five out of five.", "review_score": "5"}

There is NO shortage of this kind of material on the market. There is an endless supply of conferences, books, blogs, apps, TED Talks etc. In fact, this segment is so oversaturated that it sometimes seems too overwhelming and complex to know where to begin or whose \"method\" to follow. I will be up front and state that I am a \"seeker\" looking for sanity amidst the deluge of tasks and activities coming at me from all manner of inputs whilst fighting my own proclivities of procrastination and distraction. Rather than giving up and assuming the battle lost and hopeless, I began a seemingly endless journey of finding the proverbial silver bullet. Let me save you the time; it doesn't exist. What DOES exist are resources like Michael Hyatt\u2019s Free to Focus.\n\nIf you enjoy or practice GTD, this is the missing piece that makes it achievable. Like Lean methodology? This takes those principles and personalizes them. Breaking things down into three basic steps (Stop, Cut, Act), Mr. Hyatt proceeds to lay out an accessible, digestible, and measurable way to approach what you need to do. I have appreciated working through the online course and will enjoy the opportunity to now carry it with me so that as I work to learn and apply it, I will have this reference along the way. This is, for me, not unlike getting physically fit. I will have to continuously train, practice, and grow for the results to stick. At least he makes this fun.\n\nNot ready to dive in? No worries. Take his Personal Productivity Assessment (available on the Free to Focus website) and at least consider what it may do to aid you. He does also have other resources and tools to check out before investing in this or any of his products or \u201csystems.\u201d I would encourage you to do your due diligence but I, for one, think I may have found the thing that will come alongside me and allow me to work through that which has always most hindered my productivity; myself.", "review_score": "5"}

The other example is what's in this publication and what's not being reported or underrepresented by the same MSM and other reviews of this document.\n\n\"With all the distractions of terror and war, few Americans realize that in 2002, a Congressional Joint Inquiry was formed to investigate the 9/11 attack. The investigation was an unprecedented act by the U.S. congress. Never before had the two permanent intelligence oversight committees, one from the House and One from the Senate, collaborated on an investigation.\"\n\nYou can find the Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 (Volume One) presenting factual information in that report by clicking on my profile.\n\nAdditional material from people who work the mass media platforms presenting first hand eye witness accounts reporting they can't tell you the truth can be found in the publication, Into The Buzzsaw: LEADING JOURNALISTS EXPOSE THE MYTH OF A FREE PRESS by clicking on my profile.\n\nAlthough I think this fake investigation \"authorized\" by Rod Rosenstein who also happen to approve one of the fake FISA warrants and THEN recommend to the POTUS to fire Comey trying to black mail the POTUS, was the same Rosenstein who authorized Robert Mueller to cover up the coup attempt after Comey was fired for his misconduct is just insane that it all really happened, I have obtained this publication and wanted to share some key points it seems most are forgetting all while looking for red meat to validate this coup attempt.\n\nKindle section 605 reports the investigation did not establish the members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\n\nKindle section 637 notes the investigation applied the term, \u201ccoordination\u201d in that report did not establish the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\n\nKindle section 651 again notes the investigation did not find any evidence any U.S. personal conspired or coordinated with the IRA.\n\nKindle section 680 repeats that the investigation did not find any member of the Trump campaign [conspired] or coordinated with the Russian Government in its attempt mess up the 2016 election.\n\nKindle section 783 notes that \"...while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks\u2019s releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.\"\n\nKindle section 783 references George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty of lying to investigators \u201cabout, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud,\u2026\u201d however, Judge Moss who rendered the two weeks in jail for Mr. Papadopoulos noted, \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to believe and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason in the record to conclude that Mr. Papadopoulos had any desire to aid Russia in any way, to do anything that was contrary to the national interest.\u201d\n\nKindle section 797 notes the Mueller investigation did not find that any \u201cofficial\u2019s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also pointed out that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at Sessions\u2019s Senate office was nothing \"more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nKindle section 3996 notes again the Mueller investigation did not find any evidence the \u201cCampaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\"\n\nOnce again, Kindle section 4161 notes the evidence was not sufficient to charge anyone connected to the Trump Campaign acted as an \u201cagent of a foreign principal within the meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government of Russia, or any official thereof\u201d Specifically, the investigation found no \u201cevidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian government-or at its direction, control, or request-during the relevant time period.\"\n\nKindle section 9778 references there was no evidence to show the POTUS was involved in an \u201cunderlying crime related to Russian election interference.\"\n\nFinally, Kindle section 10398, notes to vol II: notes \u201c8. presents \"As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThere's more but I think my point has been reasonably presented in that it's been a coup attempt in our nation to cover up the real crime by the leadership of various Intel orgs in this nation as the POTUS and the rest of America are the victims.\n\nAdditional documents from my government presenting my observations has a historical justification can be found here:\n\nDOJ OIG REPORT INTO CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION: DOJ OIG RELEASES REPORT ON VARIOUS ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN ADVANCE OF THE 2016 ELECTION\n\nThe FBI, COINTELPRO, And Martin Luther King, Jr.: Final Report Of The Select Committee To Study Governmental Operations With Respect To Intelligence Activities\n\n1963 JFK Assassination: Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board - President John F.

I will be up front and state that I am a \"seeker\" looking for sanity amidst the deluge of tasks and activities coming at me from all manner of inputs whilst fighting my own proclivities of procrastination and distraction. Rather than giving up and assuming the battle lost and hopeless, I began a seemingly endless journey of finding the proverbial silver bullet. Let me save you the time; it doesn't exist.

This takes those principles and personalizes them. Breaking things down into three basic steps (Stop, Cut, Act), Mr. Hyatt proceeds to lay out an accessible, digestible, and measurable way to approach what you need to do. I have appreciated working through the online course and will enjoy the opportunity to now carry it with me so that as I work to learn and apply it, I will have this reference along the way. This is, for me, not unlike getting physically fit. I will have to continuously train, practice, and grow for the results to stick. At least he makes this fun.\n\nNot ready to dive in? No worries. Take his Personal Productivity Assessment (available on the Free to Focus website) and at least consider what it may do to aid you. He does also have other resources and tools to check out before investing in this or any of his products or \u201csystems.\u201d I would encourage you to do your due diligence but I, for one, think I may have found the thing that will come alongside me and allow me to work through that which has always most hindered my productivity; myself.", "review_score": "5"}

The story is taut, well-written, relentlessly building toward a terrifying climax.If your only acquaintance with The Shining is  from the movie by Stanley Kubrick, starring Jack Nicholson, you've missed  out on something.  Nicholson's performance, while memorable (who could ever  forget, \"Here's Johnny!\"), changed the whole story, and not for  the better.  Nicholson's crazed, wild-eyed looks let you know within five  minutes of the opening credits that the main character, Jack Torrance, is  dangerously close to a major breakdown.  The rest of the movie is  anticlimactic.In the book, however, Jack Torrance starts out as a much  different character.  He's an author, a  former heavy drinker who broke his  son's arm once in a fit of rage, got himself fired from a teaching position  by attacking a student, and has barely held his marriage and life together.  But...he _has_ stopped drinking, he's mended his marriage, he's managing  the anger, and he's taken a menial job (tending the Overlook Hotel) to  support his family.  And, because not enough time has passed to restore his  good name yet, he's doing it all while enduring distrust from those around  him, as well as occasional humiliating charity.The caretaker job does  have it's advantages though; long months of complete solitude in which he  can step back from all the problems he's had, and can take the time to  finish making things right with his family.  Not to mention that it's a  perfect place for him to finish his latest book, a story he can already see  is very good - good enough to be proud of, and good enough to put some real  momentum back in his career.In other words...Jack is back, or at least  well on his way; and even his first steps in getting it together show a lot  of promise of things to come.  Unfortunately, the Overlook, and its ghastly  inhabitants, have other plans for him, his wife, and especially his son  Danny, a five-year old psychic prodigy.  The story that ensues is more  subtle - and tragic - than anything Kubrick and Nicholson dreamed of.", "review_score": "4"}

The Overlook Hotel, a posh mountain resort in the Colorado Rockies, is no exception.  Built in the early 1900's, the Overlook's history is long and colorful.  A child dies of asphyxiation on the playground, a spurned lover leaps from a third floor window, a rich old woman commits suicide in a second floor bathtub, three men are slain in a gangland murder in the presidential suite.  Is it bad luck, or is there some deeper meaning to the Overlook's tragic past?Dick Halloran, the hotel's head chef, knows a little of the Overlook's history.  Dick has what some people would call a \"psychic twinkle\", but what he himself calls \"the shining.\"  Whatever you want to call it, what Dick has is the ability to see things that others do not.  Sometimes he can see what people are thinking.  Sometimes he can catch glimpses of the future, or the past.  For people like Dick Halloran, the Overlook Hotel seems to come alive.  The mask slips aside slightly, allowing a glimpse of the true face beneath, and the true face of the Overlook is not pleasant at all.Enter Jack Torrance.  Jack was once a young up-and-comer in the literary field.  With several published stories, a post at a prestigious New England prep school, a beautiful wife, and a young son, his destiny seemed sure.  But Jack has a couple of problems: alcoholism and rage.  The two problems combined have proven too much for Jack, costing him his job, not to mention the prospect of finding another one, and nearly costing him his family.  Luckily, Jack has friends in high places.  Al Shockley, who happens to own a controlling interest in the Overlook Hotel, sets Jack up to be the hotel's caretaker during the winter months when the Overlook is closed.  It is the perfect opportunity for Jack, Wendy, and Danny.  A positive mark on Jack's resume, and plenty of solitude for him to finish the play he has been writing.  A cooling-off period if you will.There is just one small problem.  Jack's son, five-year-old Danny, has what Dick Halloran has: the shining.  And when Dick meets the family, he is amazed to find that Danny shines stronger than anyone he has ever met.  Dick tries to warn Danny about the Overlook, but the boy is only five after all.The first couple of months at the Overlook are among the happiest that Jack, Wendy, and Danny have shared as a family, but the longer Danny, with his unusually powerful senses, spends in the hotel, the livelier the hotel becomes.  Danny is the winding key that starts the Overlook Hotel in motion.  Danny with his powerful shine.  The Overlook wants Danny so that it can run forever and ever, but to get Danny, it must first get Jack.  Poor Jack, who is already half-mad, is the perfect tool for the hotel to get what it wants.  And Jack is a willing tool.  The Overlook represents his last, best hope for getting the train-wreck of his life back on the rails.  It is a conundrum that can never be solved.  Jack must save the hotel to save his family, but the Overlook Hotel has plans of its own.Jack Torrance's slow decline into madness is as heartbreaking as it is inevitable.  Even after reading The Shining half a dozen times or so, I still find myself cheering for Jack, urging him to straighten up, to get away from the Overlook before it destroys him, always to no avail.  I can think of no other author that invokes such a strong commitment from his readers, for his characters.  Stephen King's ability to make the reader care about his characters has always been his strong point, and I can think of no other audiobook where he did it as well as he did with Jack Torrance in The Shining.Campbell Scott is kind of a no-frills audiobook narrator.  He does little to differentiate between the voices of the characters, but somehow that's okay.  Maybe I'm more lenient because The Shining is just such a great story.  I had no trouble finishing this audiobook as I do with some of the more boring narrators.The Shining is for all of us who have suffered addictions or other personal demons, and tried to overcome them.  King's own personal experience is evident throughout the audiobook.", "review_score": "5"}

A recovering alcoholic, Jack's teaching career was shot after he attacked a student who had vandelled his car. His marriage is strained to the limits, having injured his son, Danny, when on a drinking binge. Jack has been to rock bottom and is trying to claw his way back. The job at the Overlook seems to be just what Jack needs.The Overlook is a majestic hotel, nestled deep in the Rockies. Closed for the winter, the hotel requires an off-season caretaker. Jack's old drinking buddy happened to have a seat on the board and pulled some strings to get him the position. For Jack, this job would be ideal. An opportunity to stay dry, to work on his unfinished play, and to try to mend his broken family.But Jack's son has a gift and the hotel has a dark past and a life of its own.Of the bajillion and one Stephen King novels in the world, this is likely the best. King is best when he is writing about his fears, and the pages of this book are ripe with them. Many of Kings later works seem strained... but this particular work is so raw and truthful. In the best tradition of American horror - a tradition King had a large hand in creating - the book takes a typical family and then throws them hip deep into the supernatural. The fear of the ghosts and creeps in this book are made all the more frightning as they're co-mingled with fears such as providing for the family, the fear of hurting a loved one, the fear of losing one's grip on reality.And then there's the hotel.Ranking with Jackson's Hill House or Matheson's Belasco House, the Overlook Hotel is one of the best realizations of the haunted house in American literature.There have been two attempts to adapt the book to film. The first being Kubric's much ballyhoo'd adaptation, which I frankly didn't like much. The second being a made-for-tv adaptation, which came closer to the spirit of the book -if you'll pardon the pun- but still wasn't quite right. Do yourself a favour and give both films a miss and curl up in front of the fire with a nice cup of cocoa and a copy of The Shining.Tragic gives this book 10 out of 10 bottles of redrum.", "review_score": "5"}

The other example is what's in this publication and what's not being reported or underrepresented by the same MSM and other reviews of this document.\n\n\"With all the distractions of terror and war, few Americans realize that in 2002, a Congressional Joint Inquiry was formed to investigate the 9/11 attack. The investigation was an unprecedented act by the U.S. congress. Never before had the two permanent intelligence oversight committees, one from the House and One from the Senate, collaborated on an investigation.\"\n\nYou can find the Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 (Volume One) presenting factual information in that report by clicking on my profile.\n\nAdditional material from people who work the mass media platforms presenting first hand eye witness accounts reporting they can't tell you the truth can be found in the publication, Into The Buzzsaw: LEADING JOURNALISTS EXPOSE THE MYTH OF A FREE PRESS by clicking on my profile.\n\nAlthough I think this fake investigation \"authorized\" by Rod Rosenstein who also happen to approve one of the fake FISA warrants and THEN recommend to the POTUS to fire Comey trying to black mail the POTUS, was the same Rosenstein who authorized Robert Mueller to cover up the coup attempt after Comey was fired for his misconduct is just insane that it all really happened, I have obtained this publication and wanted to share some key points it seems most are forgetting all while looking for red meat to validate this coup attempt.\n\nKindle section 605 reports the investigation did not establish the members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\n\nKindle section 637 notes the investigation applied the term, \u201ccoordination\u201d in that report did not establish the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\n\nKindle section 651 again notes the investigation did not find any evidence any U.S. personal conspired or coordinated with the IRA.\n\nKindle section 680 repeats that the investigation did not find any member of the Trump campaign [conspired] or coordinated with the Russian Government in its attempt mess up the 2016 election.\n\nKindle section 783 notes that \"...while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks\u2019s releases of hacked materials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.\"\n\nKindle section 783 references George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty of lying to investigators \u201cabout, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud,\u2026\u201d however, Judge Moss who rendered the two weeks in jail for Mr. Papadopoulos noted, \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to believe and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason in the record to conclude that Mr. Papadopoulos had any desire to aid Russia in any way, to do anything that was contrary to the national interest.\u201d\n\nKindle section 797 notes the Mueller investigation did not find that any \u201cofficial\u2019s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. The investigation also pointed out that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September 2016 at Sessions\u2019s Senate office was nothing \"more than a passing mention of the presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nKindle section 3996 notes again the Mueller investigation did not find any evidence the \u201cCampaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\"\n\nOnce again, Kindle section 4161 notes the evidence was not sufficient to charge anyone connected to the Trump Campaign acted as an \u201cagent of a foreign principal within the meaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government of Russia, or any official thereof\u201d Specifically, the investigation found no \u201cevidence likely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, and Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian government-or at its direction, control, or request-during the relevant time period.\"\n\nKindle section 9778 references there was no evidence to show the POTUS was involved in an \u201cunderlying crime related to Russian election interference.\"\n\nFinally, Kindle section 10398, notes to vol II: notes \u201c8. presents \"As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nThere's more but I think my point has been reasonably presented in that it's been a coup attempt in our nation to cover up the real crime by the leadership of various Intel orgs in this nation as the POTUS and the rest of America are the victims.\n\nAdditional documents from my government presenting my observations has a historical justification can be found here:\n\nDOJ OIG REPORT INTO CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION: DOJ OIG RELEASES REPORT ON VARIOUS ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN ADVANCE OF THE 2016 ELECTION\n\nThe FBI, COINTELPRO, And Martin Luther King, Jr.: Final Report Of The Select Committee To Study Governmental Operations With Respect To Intelligence Activities\n\n1963 JFK Assassination: Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board - President John F.

Perdita desperately wants to reunite her mother with her Druhastranian friend, Gretel Kercheval. The Lee family gingerbread recipe was stolen from the Kercheval family.In an effort to understand her heritage, Perdita tries making the recipe, but adds ingredients andwinds up in a coma. Harriet knows she finally owes her daughter the long-avoided truth about her origins.Oyeyemi takes the familiar children's tale and twists it into something completely different. I may be in the minority on this one, but I was just lost most of the time, without the benefits of a bread-crumb trail.

The cookbook is amazing and has some great pictures... We look forward to trying some of the different foods as we are trying to reduce the use of foods with preservatives for our family of seven and trying to make more of our foods ourselves....this is a learning curve and this book seems to lay it out in an easy to follow format and process. So far the kids, even our picky eaters, have loved the recipes we have tried so far, we look forward to trying more of them in the coming days and weeks.

Whiles the best idealogy, conservatism has been viewed as a thing for the elderly for far too long. Young adults have mostly embraced liberalism because liberalism is tied with progressivism. It becomes hard to hold conversations with people of your race when you have a differing view. You are mostly singled out and hated. It becomes a weapon to make you surrender, but I don't cave even though a lot of conservative young adults get billed into obeying. They cut you off from conversations and make fun of you as well as those in authority cut off your funding and make life horrible for you. This is the new America that is being pushed by the left.When I first heard Ben speak, I felt a great sense of relief that conservatives will rise again and have a voice without being overly vilified or bullied into subjection. With President Trump also pushing back against the liberal machinery and institutional intolerance to free speech, it is gradually becoming refreshing to be in the greatest country on Earth.We're not done.

There is NO shortage of this kind of material on the market. There is an endless supply of conferences, books, blogs, apps, TED Talks etc. In fact, this segment is so oversaturated that it sometimes seems too overwhelming and complex to know where to begin or whose \"method\" to follow. I will be up front and state that I am a \"seeker\" looking for sanity amidst the deluge of tasks and activities coming at me from all manner of inputs whilst fighting my own proclivities of procrastination and distraction. Rather than giving up and assuming the battle lost and hopeless, I began a seemingly endless journey of finding the proverbial silver bullet. Let me save you the time; it doesn't exist. What DOES exist are resources like Michael Hyatt\u2019s Free to Focus.\n\nIf you enjoy or practice GTD, this is the missing piece that makes it achievable. Like Lean methodology? This takes those principles and personalizes them. Breaking things down into three basic steps (Stop, Cut, Act), Mr. Hyatt proceeds to lay out an accessible, digestible, and measurable way to approach what you need to do. I have appreciated working through the online course and will enjoy the opportunity to now carry it with me so that as I work to learn and apply it, I will have this reference along the way. This is, for me, not unlike getting physically fit. I will have to continuously train, practice, and grow for the results to stick. At least he makes this fun.\n\nNot ready to dive in? No worries. Take his Personal Productivity Assessment (available on the Free to Focus website) and at least consider what it may do to aid you. He does also have other resources and tools to check out before investing in this or any of his products or \u201csystems.\u201d I would encourage you to do your due diligence but I, for one, think I may have found the thing that will come alongside me and allow me to work through that which has always most hindered my productivity; myself.", "review_score": "5"}

Simple Cake by Odette Williams is a practical guide/cookbook to baking simple and tasty cakes and desserts. I happened to have extra lemons and decided to try the recipe for the Lovely Lemon Yogurt Cake.  The recipe was very easy to execute; to prep and prepare the batter, it only took about 15 minutes.  The cake baked up well in a loaf pan.  My loaf pan was small, so I was able to bake up two additional ramekin sized cakes.  I appreciated that Odette offered variations to the recipe and suggested toppings, such as adding a glaze or soaking the cake in a citrus syrup.  The lovely part is that there was a simple glaze recipe and a syrup recipe later in other sections of this comprehensive book.  The glaze and the syrup did add extra citrus flavor to the simple lemon cake.  I think the cake would have been a bit underwhelming if I hadn't added the glaze and the lemon syrup soak.  I will definitely use this recipe again and plan to add poppy seeds (a suggested variation) to the batter next time. The recipes seem very easy to follow with ingredients easily found in my pantry and refrigerator.  This cookbook is divided into sections, starting with the basic foundational cake/dessert recipes and continuing on with suggestions on how to complete the cake (glazes, frostings, sauces) and occasions for baking these desserts. I am inspired to make a chocolate tres leches cake! This is a practical dessert cookbook to have on my kitchen shelf and it will be a great resource when I bake cakes and desserts for family and friends.

When I saw Patton Oswalt's recent interview on TV about his deceased wife, Michelle McNamara, and her obsession with finding the identity of the Golden State Killer, I was hooked.  Michelle had been working the case for years only to die at the age of 46 of natural causes, leaving Patton and their young daughter behind.  She hadn't finished her book or her search.  I am grateful that others chose to finish the book for her.This perpetrator was without a doubt the creepiest I have ever read about.  He knowingly entered homes occupied by his victims.  After starting with women home alone, he decided to take on couples.  It was especially creepy because even though he hadn't struck since 1986, he was either dead, incarcerated, or still out there.  I have worked in law enforcement and am not by any means a timid person, but he scared the bejesus out of me, which was exactly his intent.  DNA was in its infancy, but the police did have his.  Over the years, it provided more accurate information.  His DNA linked together many victims, but his DNA was not in CODIS or any other criminal base.When Michelle died, one of the things on her \"to do\" list was to find out a way to use private DNA companies, such as Ancestry.com to look for him.  In the end, that was exactly how he was caught.  Unfortunately, this happened about a year after Michelle died so it is not in the book.  How sad that she was on the right track, but didn't get to see the fruits of her labor.  Using DNA from a small private company, Joseph DeAngelo was arrested in April of 2018.  He lived right in Sacramento where many of his crimes had been perpetrated.  He was a police officer in Auburn, California, when he started his crime spree.Michelle's \"Epilogue:  Letter to an Old Man\" is quite chilling.  I am sure there will be another book (or addendum) after DeAngelo is adjudicated.  He is 72, and I'm disappointed that he can't be made to suffer longer.  But I'm especially sorry that Michelle can't be the one to write the story.I finished the book last night in bed.  As I tried to sleep afterwards, my husband and little dog beside me, I heard a noise in the kitchen like something being dropped.  My dog heard it, too.  My first thought was, \"The Creeper\".  .", "review_score": "5"}

Aside from Jude Watson\u2019s young reader series Jedi Apprentice (which came out 17 years ago, is now Legends, and is out of print), there have been very few stories exploring this captivating Jedi who we first saw in The Phantom Menace. Beyond that film, our knowledge of the character is very limited. We know he was an apprentice to Count Dooku, and that he was the master of Obi-Wan Kenobi. But who was this mysterious Jedi master, one quick to believe in Jedi prophecies of a chosen one, one who Dooku teased would have joined him and the Separatists if he were still alive, and ultimately the one who taught Master Yoda how to become one with the Force? Finally we have a book that begins that exploration of the character. Master & Apprentice not only yields a better understanding of Qui-Gon, but also Obi-Wan, the Jedi prophecies, the Jedi council, and Count Dooku himself. On top of all that, it\u2019s a great read with enjoyable characters and entertaining plot. It\u2019s hard to ask for more.\n\nSet around seven years prior to The Phantom Menace, this book explores the relationship between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan as they set upon a mission to a far off world that will define the destinies before them. There is a queen coming to power on a planet called Pijal and a representative of the Republic is needed to oversee a treaty that will open up this area of space to an important hyperspace corridor. If all goes well, it will mean much needed supplies and resources for isolated worlds. But of course there are complications. Apparently not everyone is happy about the upcoming events, and an opposition movement presents problems that the Jedi will have to investigate. Things get more complicated and messier from there as the tension builds and the plot unfurls. Without spoiling anything, it provides an enjoyable backbone that drives the story along.\n\nAdding to the main story is a series of subplots which are just as interesting and enticing. One of the biggest underlying themes that is explored is that of slavery. Going to Pijal, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan come face to face with it and have to reconcile how such a practice can exist and why the Jedi have not done more to combat it. Some of the new characters introduced in the book get woven into the slavery plot, and it becomes a very compelling element to the story. Not only is it a good story point in itself, but it builds upon the greater story of Star Wars and Anakin Skywalker\u2019s position as a slave. Beyond that, the book explores the Jedi prophecies and the Jedi mystics. It establishes Qui-Gon\u2019s interest in them, how that came to be, why they are somewhat taboo in the Jedi Order, and how they become so important to Qui-Gon going forward. Again, it\u2019s a very interesting element to the story and it adds to the greater picture as it ties-in with the films and animated series. The exploration of those prophecies also leads to the exploration of Dooku.\n\nWhile the cover of the book features Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, the title embraces much more than just those two. We get a deep look at Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan\u2019s relationship, which is nowhere near as smooth as I thought it would be. The friction between the two is actually a wonderful surprise as it adds to the tension in the book. Through this adventure, we see where that relationship could have gone, and where it ultimately heads. But beyond them, we also get a glimpse of Dooku and Qui-Gon as master and apprentice, which is so tantalizing delicious. There are passages threaded throughout the story that provides a peek into the past and show us moments of what their apprenticeship was like. We gain insight at how Qui-Gon looked at Dooku, and insight on just who Dooku was as a Jedi, and the clues of his fall. Plus we learn of another apprentice Dooku had which helps shed more light on this mysterious character who chose to leave the order and become a Sith.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say too much without giving away the plot or spoiling anything, but it\u2019s certainly worth the effort. Master & Apprentice is a great read that offers enjoyment on many levels for Star Wars fans. It\u2019s a wonderful exploration of the characters, the Force, Jedi, philosophy, and finding one\u2019s purpose in life. It\u2019s both a fun journey and a rewarding one as you learn more about the greater story of Star Wars, and the personal journey within this one. I give it a five out of five.", "review_score": "5"}

Hill", "book_id": "198211598X", "review_id": "RWRIR15LTOU1U", "timestamp": 1555158294, "review_text": "In the early stages of Stephen King's career, he wanted to put his own twist on some of the hallmarks of the horror genre, including vampires with Salem's Lot and the haunted house story, or in this case haunted hotel, with The Shining. This horrific tale of ghosts, possession, and murder ranks as one of King's all-time scariest, and spawned the Stanley Kubrick film that most regard as a classic in its own right. Most fans are aware that King was disappointed by some aspects of that film, including its failure to establish that Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel as a good father, a dedicated family man who would never think of bringing harm to his wife or son. In many ways, Torrance reflects the pressures and frustration King himself experienced as a young husband and father, a character prone to the same occasional impatience or anger as any normal person. However, when those frailties are placed in the hands of the malevolent forces at work in the Overlook, they become warped and distorted. Jack's descent into insanity is a gradual process initiated and controlled by external influences, a point left ambiguous in Kubrick's film. The film even hints at an inherent madness in the character before ever reaching the Overlook, so the differences from King's story are significant. Kubrick also excludes King's central metaphor of the boiler, which Jack has to release the pressure from periodically to avoid a powerful explosion. It's used in the novel to represent Jack's escalating rage as his mental instability progresses and is key to the book's plot, particularly the climax. I'm not knocking the filmmaking of Kubrick, but like most King fans, I prefer the novel. If you're looking for a scare and haven't already read The Shining, imagine the possibilities of an enormous hotel filled with malicious ghosts, a small, young family snowed in and isolated from all civilization, and the writing of a young Stephen King. One of King's top five novels.", "review_score": "5"}

Then spooky things start happening. But that's not even the horror part of this story.What I noticed was that every time something bad happened to Jack, guess who was ALWAYS with him? Good ol' Al Shockley. When he hit a kid's bike in the road (with, mysteriously, no kid attached), Al was with him. When somebody rigged the timer (or did they?), Al was hanging around. When he went to bars and drank, Al was his drinking buddy, even though Al knew Jack had a drinking problem. Al got him the job at the hotel. Good ol' Al. When Jack is killed and his traumatized wife and son are staying with Dick Halloran for a while, what does Wendy say? \"I think we'll take Al Shockley up on his offer.\" The end.OMG. Al Shockley is an undercurrent in this entire book, easy to overlook if you blink, or if you don't understand that Stephen King doesn't put irrelevant characters in his books.\"Somebody\" wants Jack out of the way. Somebody wants control of Danny and his gifts. Why, and who? And what are they going to do with it? You can probably guess who I'm thinking of. The brilliance of this novel is that open-ended question that most readers miss completely - the faint but sinister presence of Al and his undefined motives. A mystery with no ending. A book that's more horrifying for its insinuations than for its graphic imagery. That's probably the reason this book sticks in my memory more than any other of King's works.

Questioning wars without a legitimate cause, rampant political corruption, the runaway CIA, censorship, a seemingly concerted effort to destroy the earth and the health of its people, and the difficulty in discerning the truth from a broad range of sources was always on my mind. Q began posting in late October and I discovered him/them sometime the next month. I\u2019ve always been a political junkie and lover of mysteries and I quickly became obsessed with following Q\u2019s posts and the many citizen journalists and investigative reporters providing their research, interpretations and opinions. I was relieved and excited to see young people with a profound interest in politics that I hadn\u2019t really seen since the 60\u2019s and equally happy to see the retired folks committed to finding the truth. Many of the writers who contributed to this book feel like old friends. I\u2019ve looked forward to their daily podcasts and blogs. There seems to be some Bernie supporters among us.

Hill", "book_id": "198211598X", "review_id": "RWRIR15LTOU1U", "timestamp": 1555158294, "review_text": "In the early stages of Stephen King's career, he wanted to put his own twist on some of the hallmarks of the horror genre, including vampires with Salem's Lot and the haunted house story, or in this case haunted hotel, with The Shining. This horrific tale of ghosts, possession, and murder ranks as one of King's all-time scariest, and spawned the Stanley Kubrick film that most regard as a classic in its own right. Most fans are aware that King was disappointed by some aspects of that film, including its failure to establish that Jack Torrance arrives at the Overlook Hotel as a good father, a dedicated family man who would never think of bringing harm to his wife or son. In many ways, Torrance reflects the pressures and frustration King himself experienced as a young husband and father, a character prone to the same occasional impatience or anger as any normal person. However, when those frailties are placed in the hands of the malevolent forces at work in the Overlook, they become warped and distorted. Jack's descent into insanity is a gradual process initiated and controlled by external influences, a point left ambiguous in Kubrick's film. The film even hints at an inherent madness in the character before ever reaching the Overlook, so the differences from King's story are significant. Kubrick also excludes King's central metaphor of the boiler, which Jack has to release the pressure from periodically to avoid a powerful explosion. It's used in the novel to represent Jack's escalating rage as his mental instability progresses and is key to the book's plot, particularly the climax. I'm not knocking the filmmaking of Kubrick, but like most King fans, I prefer the novel. If you're looking for a scare and haven't already read The Shining, imagine the possibilities of an enormous hotel filled with malicious ghosts, a small, young family snowed in and isolated from all civilization, and the writing of a young Stephen King. One of King's top five novels.", "review_score": "5"}

Joe M\u2019s \u201cPlan to Save the World\u201d is all I\u2019ve read so far, but I\u2019ve found a kindred spirit with many of the same questions that have always troubled me. Questioning wars without a legitimate cause, rampant political corruption, the runaway CIA, censorship, a seemingly concerted effort to destroy the earth and the health of its people, and the difficulty in discerning the truth from a broad range of sources was always on my mind. Q began posting in late October and I discovered him/them sometime the next month. I\u2019ve always been a political junkie and lover of mysteries and I quickly became obsessed with following Q\u2019s posts and the many citizen journalists and investigative reporters providing their research, interpretations and opinions. I was relieved and excited to see young people with a profound interest in politics that I hadn\u2019t really seen since the 60\u2019s and equally happy to see the retired folks committed to finding the truth. Many of the writers who contributed to this book feel like old friends. I\u2019ve looked forward to their daily podcasts and blogs. There seems to be some Bernie supporters among us. If nothing else, Bernie opened our eyes to the massive corruption of the primary process. I hope the people who consider the Q movement just another conspiracy theory and rely on network news will take a few steps out of their comfort zone.

I will be up front and state that I am a \"seeker\" looking for sanity amidst the deluge of tasks and activities coming at me from all manner of inputs whilst fighting my own proclivities of procrastination and distraction. Rather than giving up and assuming the battle lost and hopeless, I began a seemingly endless journey of finding the proverbial silver bullet. Let me save you the time; it doesn't exist. What DOES exist are resources like Michael Hyatt\u2019s Free to Focus.\n\nIf you enjoy or practice GTD, this is the missing piece that makes it achievable. Like Lean methodology? This takes those principles and personalizes them. Breaking things down into three basic steps (Stop, Cut, Act), Mr. Hyatt proceeds to lay out an accessible, digestible, and measurable way to approach what you need to do. I have appreciated working through the online course and will enjoy the opportunity to now carry it with me so that as I work to learn and apply it, I will have this reference along the way. This is, for me, not unlike getting physically fit. I will have to continuously train, practice, and grow for the results to stick. At least he makes this fun.\n\nNot ready to dive in? No worries. Take his Personal Productivity Assessment (available on the Free to Focus website) and at least consider what it may do to aid you. He does also have other resources and tools to check out before investing in this or any of his products or \u201csystems.\u201d I would encourage you to do your due diligence but I, for one, think I may have found the thing that will come alongside me and allow me to work through that which has always most hindered my productivity; myself.", "review_score": "5"}

I say that very confidently because as a kid growing up back then I remember his name being mentioned frequently when Joan Rivers would ask on the red carpet \"Who are you wearing?\". And while he might not be dressing the A-List crowd as much anymore, he is still involved in the fashion world and he also has found a place in front of the camera on various tv shows. Definitely fair to say there is a lot of creativity flowing through his veins.I'll admit, I mainly wanted to read this book to hear some good fashion world stories. I was impressed he was able to make Anna Wintour sound almost human rather than the cold image she normally presents to the rest of the world. And I thought it was really cool he not only got to meet his idol, Liza Minnelli, but also strike up a friendship. I found it fascinating that seemingly overnight celebrities just started expecting to get free clothes from designers to wear to events and how that is the norm now. For sure my favorite parts of the book involved just random stuff about celebrities.I did find myself bored from time to time with the first half of the book. His childhood growing up as a gay male in a Syrian Jewish family was certainly fascinating but there were parts that dragged on a bit. I did enjoy the parts of the book that explored his relationship with his parents and his siblings and their families. His relationship with his mother in particular sounds supportive in some sense but also complicated. I'm glad he included what it was like living in New York at the height of the AIDS epidemic. It seems like too many people have long forgotten what a scary and difficult time period that was so it was good to hear his perspective.I read an advance copy of this book and was disappointed that the Golden Globes groping incident with Scarlett Johansson was not mentioned. It got big press back in 2006 and it seems like such a glaring omission to not have some sort of explanation in the book especially living in the #metoo era. I really do hope his thoughts on the matter find their way into this book before it's published.Overall, I do recommend this book not only if you are a fan of his but also he really is a unique individual so if you like memoirs this is a pretty safe bet.I won a free copy of this book but was under no obligation to post a review.

Each chapter of Lost Roses is told from the point of view of one of the three main characters--a wealthy American woman, her friend a Russian princess, and a Russian peasant. This rotating viewpoint allows Kelly to both further the story but also to provide information that helps to paint a fuller picture of what is happening. Many times information shared by one character would provide insight into something that happened to another character or would foreshadow a future event. As the characters had diverse backgrounds, Kelly was able to realistically portray both sides of the Russian revolution and how it was perceived by outsiders.\n\nThis book is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and particularly anyone who enjoys reading about Russian history.

I will be up front and state that I am a \"seeker\" looking for sanity amidst the deluge of tasks and activities coming at me from all manner of inputs whilst fighting my own proclivities of procrastination and distraction. Rather than giving up and assuming the battle lost and hopeless, I began a seemingly endless journey of finding the proverbial silver bullet. Let me save you the time; it doesn't exist. What DOES exist are resources like Michael Hyatt\u2019s Free to Focus.\n\nIf you enjoy or practice GTD, this is the missing piece that makes it achievable. Like Lean methodology? This takes those principles and personalizes them. Breaking things down into three basic steps (Stop, Cut, Act), Mr. Hyatt proceeds to lay out an accessible, digestible, and measurable way to approach what you need to do. I have appreciated working through the online course and will enjoy the opportunity to now carry it with me so that as I work to learn and apply it, I will have this reference along the way. This is, for me, not unlike getting physically fit. I will have to continuously train, practice, and grow for the results to stick. At least he makes this fun.\n\nNot ready to dive in? No worries. Take his Personal Productivity Assessment (available on the Free to Focus website) and at least consider what it may do to aid you. He does also have other resources and tools to check out before investing in this or any of his products or \u201csystems.\u201d I would encourage you to do your due diligence but I, for one, think I may have found the thing that will come alongside me and allow me to work through that which has always most hindered my productivity; myself.", "review_score": "5"}

Without a doubt it is one of the best books I have ever read. I really enjoyed the movie, yet the book is better by far. The movie is what made me want to read the book. The movie is good, but if I had read the book and then watched the movie, I would have been disappointed. The book is far greater than the movie.The book was hard to put down from the get go. I could picture everything in my mind. I pictured the life of the Torrance's and the struggles that they had been through in the recent past. I pictured the Overlook Hotel where Jack Torrance and his family stayed while he was the caretaker over the winter.Slowly throughout their stay at the Overlook, Jack uncovers a lot of strange happenings that occurred in the Overlook. The more he uncovers, the more the hotel gets to him, as if it were alive itself... He begins to lose his cool, as well as his mind.There are many things that haunt the Overlook, and Jack's son, Danny, is able to see all of it. He can see all of the horrible things that happened in the past, as well as get dreadful hints of the future. He can see the hotel get to his father, yet he has no power to stop it.I highly recommend this book. King makes it so real that you start to question whether it is really fiction or not.", "review_score": "5"}

After hearing in recent media Stephen King's utter disdain for what is one of my favorite films, I decided to read the book to weigh in for myself.  I took the book along on our family vacation to Mexico and stayed up most nights reading, in the dark, the only light coming from my son's skull book light clip (he's a huge R.L.Stine fan).  This book terrified me.  I was often too scared to read more than a few pages at a time in the dark, and had to read during the day on the beach.  Pretty silly for a grown woman, I know!  Stephen King is a master of making his readers feel intimate to his books' characters.  The imagery that came from reading this terrifying story is much more frightening than even those creepy twins and elevators spilling blood that Stanley Kubrick produced.  Seriously, if you haven't read Stephen King's The Shining, it's a MUST for any SK fan.  Can't wait to read Doctor Sleep...", "review_score": "5"}

There is NO shortage of this kind of material on the market. There is an endless supply of conferences, books, blogs, apps, TED Talks etc. In fact, this segment is so oversaturated that it sometimes seems too overwhelming and complex to know where to begin or whose \"method\" to follow. I will be up front and state that I am a \"seeker\" looking for sanity amidst the deluge of tasks and activities coming at me from all manner of inputs whilst fighting my own proclivities of procrastination and distraction. Rather than giving up and assuming the battle lost and hopeless, I began a seemingly endless journey of finding the proverbial silver bullet. Let me save you the time; it doesn't exist. What DOES exist are resources like Michael Hyatt\u2019s Free to Focus.\n\nIf you enjoy or practice GTD, this is the missing piece that makes it achievable. Like Lean methodology? This takes those principles and personalizes them. Breaking things down into three basic steps (Stop, Cut, Act), Mr. Hyatt proceeds to lay out an accessible, digestible, and measurable way to approach what you need to do. I have appreciated working through the online course and will enjoy the opportunity to now carry it with me so that as I work to learn and apply it, I will have this reference along the way. This is, for me, not unlike getting physically fit. I will have to continuously train, practice, and grow for the results to stick. At least he makes this fun.\n\nNot ready to dive in? No worries. Take his Personal Productivity Assessment (available on the Free to Focus website) and at least consider what it may do to aid you. He does also have other resources and tools to check out before investing in this or any of his products or \u201csystems.\u201d I would encourage you to do your due diligence but I, for one, think I may have found the thing that will come alongside me and allow me to work through that which has always most hindered my productivity; myself.", "review_score": "5"}

There is NO shortage of this kind of material on the market.

I will be up front and state that I am a \"seeker\" looking for sanity amidst the deluge of tasks and activities coming at me from all manner of inputs whilst fighting my own proclivities of procrastination and distraction. Rather than giving up and assuming the battle lost and hopeless, I began a seemingly endless journey of finding the proverbial silver bullet. Let me save you the time; it doesn't exist. What DOES exist are resources like Michael Hyatt\u2019s Free to Focus.\n\nIf you enjoy or practice GTD, this is the missing piece that makes it achievable. Like Lean methodology? This takes those principles and personalizes them. Breaking things down into three basic steps (Stop, Cut, Act), Mr. Hyatt proceeds to lay out an accessible, digestible, and measurable way to approach what you need to do. I have appreciated working through the online course and will enjoy the opportunity to now carry it with me so that as I work to learn and apply it, I will have this reference along the way. This is, for me, not unlike getting physically fit. I will have to continuously train, practice, and grow for the results to stick. At least he makes this fun.\n\nNot ready to dive in? No worries. Take his Personal Productivity Assessment (available on the Free to Focus website) and at least consider what it may do to aid you. He does also have other resources and tools to check out before investing in this or any of his products or \u201csystems.\u201d I would encourage you to do your due diligence but I, for one, think I may have found the thing that will come alongside me and allow me to work through that which has always most hindered my productivity; myself.", "review_score": "5"}

The author is a male, but he chooses to tells this story through his main character who is a woman. Only thing is, nothing about her portrayal as a female is at all female to me. Nothing rings true, not even a little bit. Nothing maternal,where maternal is called for, nothing sexy about her in any detail of the plot where such would be expected, nothing soft, simply bogus. Even her appearance is somehow out of sync with what we know. She is 30-something, but in every description I\u2019m seeing a septuagenarian, or older. Very weird choices have been made by the author . Also, his overdosing us with her alcohol and drug habit is cloying. Enough already! I get it; she uses substance to get through having been traumatized by events, but at the rate we witness her imbibing and drugging, she would not even be able to notice anything from her windows, were she even able to remain conscious enough to see out of them, and yet, the author asks us to suspend our logic as he wants us to believe him as much as she wants to convince the police that she saw what she saw. All too tedious and really got hideously in the way of what could have been a pretty good read. I just did not like this book. No literary merit here that I could find. This plot is pretty conventional, so at the end of the day, to be outstanding, an author would have to really work on character development and details presented in a fresh and lyrical way,", "review_score": "5"}

The author is a male, but he chooses to tells this story through his main character who is a woman. Only thing is, nothing about her portrayal as a female is at all female to me. Nothing rings true, not even a little bit. Nothing maternal,where maternal is called for, nothing sexy about her in any detail of the plot where such would be expected, nothing soft, simply bogus. Even her appearance is somehow out of sync with what we know. She is 30-something, but in every description I\u2019m seeing a septuagenarian, or older. Very weird choices have been made by the author . Also, his overdosing us with her alcohol and drug habit is cloying. Enough already! I get it; she uses substance to get through having been traumatized by events, but at the rate we witness her imbibing and drugging, she would not even be able to notice anything from her windows, were she even able to remain conscious enough to see out of them, and yet, the author asks us to suspend our logic as he wants us to believe him as much as she wants to convince the police that she saw what she saw. All too tedious and really got hideously in the way of what could have been a pretty good read. I just did not like this book. No literary merit here that I could find. This plot is pretty conventional, so at the end of the day, to be outstanding, an author would have to really work on character development and details presented in a fresh and lyrical way,", "review_score": "5"}

There is NO shortage of this kind of material on the market. There is an endless supply of conferences, books, blogs, apps, TED Talks etc. In fact, this segment is so oversaturated that it sometimes seems too overwhelming and complex to know where to begin or whose \"method\" to follow. I will be up front and state that I am a \"seeker\" looking for sanity amidst the deluge of tasks and activities coming at me from all manner of inputs whilst fighting my own proclivities of procrastination and distraction. Rather than giving up and assuming the battle lost and hopeless, I began a seemingly endless journey of finding the proverbial silver bullet. Let me save you the time; it doesn't exist. What DOES exist are resources like Michael Hyatt\u2019s Free to Focus.\n\nIf you enjoy or practice GTD, this is the missing piece that makes it achievable. Like Lean methodology? This takes those principles and personalizes them. Breaking things down into three basic steps (Stop, Cut, Act), Mr. Hyatt proceeds to lay out an accessible, digestible, and measurable way to approach what you need to do. I have appreciated working through the online course and will enjoy the opportunity to now carry it with me so that as I work to learn and apply it, I will have this reference along the way. This is, for me, not unlike getting physically fit. I will have to continuously train, practice, and grow for the results to stick. At least he makes this fun.\n\nNot ready to dive in? No worries. Take his Personal Productivity Assessment (available on the Free to Focus website) and at least consider what it may do to aid you. He does also have other resources and tools to check out before investing in this or any of his products or \u201csystems.\u201d I would encourage you to do your due diligence but I, for one, think I may have found the thing that will come alongside me and allow me to work through that which has always most hindered my productivity; myself.", "review_score": "5"}

Jordan has a new stepmother but there's something very wrong with Annaliese.  Seriously.  Nina- Nina is one of the best characters I've read in a long time.  She's a rip roaring Soviet pilot who is out for the Huntress- and she's married to Ian, who rescued her from her sickbed in Poland.  How these come together makes for a fascinating story. Well plotted with characters you can feel, this is so worth your time.  My only quibble- and I must point this out because whoever edited this otherwise perfect book should have caught it- is that Jordan is served a slice of German chocolate cake at her father's funeral in 1950.

Look at what socialist policies, promoted as \"social justice\" and \"progressivism\" have done to destroy the middle class and pool the wealth of the world for the evil elites. The main stream media simply will not tell you about the massive protests and revolutions going on in countries that have taken away the rights of the people and imposed so many taxes that people have difficulty buying food and just surviving. That's because the main stream media has been bought and paid for by the very same evil elites who want you fooled and docile.

I love Fleetwood Mac. A lot! A story of rock and roll in the 1970s full of larger than life characters and their drama. Yes, please! Sign me up! I was initially disappointed in the interview format of the book. It was hard for me to get into. Without a typical descriptive narrative, I had a hard time picturing the characters and their world. But the story had me hooked, so I kept reading. And I\u2019m so glad I did. By the time I was about a third of the way through the book, I was enjoying the oral interview format of the book. It was playing out in my mind like an episode of VH1\u2019s \u201cBehind the Music\u201d. Since individuals experience the same events differently, and memory can be a tricksy beast, I really enjoyed the differences in the band members\u2019 recollections and how perception and misunderstandings shaped the band members\u2019 relationships with each other. And then that subtle little twist at the end had me close to tears. DAISY JONES AND THE SIX is a story about music, love and friendship and the pressures and joys that come with them. But more than that it\u2019s a story about the choices we make, the things we do and don\u2019t do, the things we say and don\u2019t say and how the intersection of those words and actions shapes not only our lives, but the lives of the people we love. And wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if someone could record \u201cAurora\u201d. I would love to listen to that. DAISY JONES AND THE SIX is a 4.5 out of 5 \ud83c\udf1f for me. I can\u2019t wait to see what Taylor comes up with next. \ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcda", "review_score": "4"}

As a voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction crime novels, I was really looking forward to it.  All of the sterling reviews and \"NY Times Bestseller\" designation suggested that it would be gripping.  NOT!  In effect, the book essentially describes the many rapes and murders committed by an anonymous psychopath, bouncing back and forth between and among many venues and many time periods.  For reasons that escape me, the authors who assembled the researcher's notes and manuscripts never provide a sufficient context for their work.  Unless the reader already knows the entire backstory, the book can be confusing and, frankly, boring.  Unless one enjoys reading account after account how the culprit entered homes and committed atrocities, the narrative sometimes feels like you're reliving Groundhog Day.  Personal insights by the pursuer are occasionally insightful, and the methodology of criminal pursuit (as it has evolved with technology), might make the book an interesting work for criminal justice classes on the history of criminology.  I found it to be neither enlightening nor interesting.", "review_score": "1"}

Granted, I am a fan of his career even though I have often disagreed with him. He is one of the great minds of the century, much like the incredible Charles Krauthammer. Both put their love of the Constitution and their personal values ahead of their politics. Mr Dershowitz is a liberal and a Hillary supporter, but based his introduction on the law He is a longtime law professor at Harvard. So very odd that people have found his introduction to be biased towards Trump when it is all about the law. Guess people are so blinded by their obsessive hatred of Trump that the law no longer matters to them or they are just trying to skew the reviews. If you are interested in a fair legal analysis of the report, this book is for you. Alan Dershowitz doesn\u2019t let his personal politics spin the law. The Mueller Report will put you to sleep, however.\nAs an aside, it will be a sad day when people are so intolerant of differing views that great conversations will be silenced.

I also suggest East area Rapist/Golden State Killer by Kat Winters to get more details about actual attacks and methods he used.  Sudden Terror is more witness and detective oriented with info on crimes, the other is more crime fact based where you are to draw your own conclusions.  I think they are a must read together and possibly before you read this book!  The recommended books dive more into the crimes where Michelle goes more into the man.  She does briefly go over some things the killer was known for, but we know she died well before her time and before her beloved book was finished which is why I think you need the other books for companion pieces if you want a larger scope of this illusive heartless killer.

I absolutely love the way that Michael defines the importance of productivity not as working more efficiently so you can do more, but rather working more intentionally to do the right things so that you are free to focus on what matters most.\n\nThe additional tools, templates, and exercises throughout the book's chapters are incredibly helpful for actually putting these ideas into practice. One of my biggest pitfalls in reading and learning is that I'm presented with amazing ideas, but then I struggle to actually practice them in a way that transforms my life. Hyatt's book's exercise really help you apply what you learn.\n\nThis system has completely changed my personal and professional life. I can't recommend it highly enough.", "review_score": "5"}

The fresh start in Maine appears to be the change Creed yearns for.  A bad relationship with his father-in-law, the redoubtable Irwin Goldman and soured on city living, Maine appears to be the answer to his questions.Set in 1983-1984, Creed appears to be the picture of the 1980s YUPPIE (Young Urban Professional).  Established in his career with the ability to relocate also point up to this very positive, professional image.Each character is drawn with realistic words; each character becomes vivid and believable, again evidence of a master storyteller.  My favorite part in this book was Creed's \"last happy day, 3/24/84,\" the day he spent flying kites with Gage, then just 2.Once settled in Maine, life and death appear to shift and the line dividing the two becomes blurry and indistinct, thanks to King's superb storytelling.  A graveyard for pets dating back to the early 20th Century is near the Creed home and a very chilling secret lurks there.Death appears to lurk in every corner of the small town.  First, the Creed cat is killed by a truck on the truck infested roadway near their home.  Gage is killed in May of 1984 after he darts away from Creed and into the path of an oncoming truck.  Rachel describes the agonizing death of her older sister Zelda in 1965 when Zelda was 10 and Rachel 8.  Rachel's fear of death causes her to lash out at Creed when he gently explains the death of the cat to Ellie; she refuses to attend a neighbor's funeral and barely gets through Gage's.Creed uncovers the mystery of the Pet Sematary (so spelled by local children who have buried their pets there) and uses what he has learned to make the dividing line between life and death questionable and indistinct.This is one of King's best stories!", "review_score": "5"}

Caro takes us to the edge of the precipice and leaves us there.\nNo doubt, he is haunted by visions of another New York investigative reporter who got too close to the truth. C", "review_score": "5"}

It is a very complex book requiring thoughtful attention while reading it (or listening to it as I did over miles and miles, both in Washington state and in Virginia and North Carolina). The characters develop slowly and in what seems to be individual short stories that eventually spread tendrils into one another. There are segments that are pure natural history/botanical facts, there are posed philosophical questions over and over, and there is both hope and hopelessness. Once I finished it I decided I needed to immediately read it with yellow marker in hand. Beautiful writing, thoughtful notions, anguishing questions to consider. This will be/is a wonderful book club book for groups who choose to actually READ and DISCUSS the book; it would make a whole quarter's worth of coursework/discussion at the college level for English majors, IT folks, and those who relish ecological connections.

There's no humanity in the individual much less expertise. I had hoped I'd laugh my way thru the descriptions & was hoping for hilarity as Chris Matthews suggested but instead I was saddened at how despicable Trump is. He cheapens the game of golf and I marvel at how many go along with his attitude and don't seem to care. Shame on them! Shame on anyone who looks the other way whenever Trump is around because this is his method whether it's golf, governing or acting like he cares about anything but himself.", "review_score": "4"}

It's more pathetic than funny. Yes, it identifies Trump's pathological lying attitude comparing his obsessive need to win at all costs to the game of golf that should be the epitome of an honorable game. Thing is the book is repetitive & I found it tough to read the entire book because it cites the same old/same old on every page. Trump lies, steals, misrepresents,cheats again & again & doesn't care one iota and keeps dishing out his dirt regardless if you are a VIP, celebrity or know nothing. He's obsessed with winning and holds no value in integrity much less the honor of the game.

Unfortunately, I appeared to have missed one and I would have liked to have read it before this one.  I would like to have met Mark Scott and read his adventures with Maisie before tackling this one but I was able to keep up.The one thing that niggled me in this book was Maisie's preoccupation with what Scott, an American agent, was doing in London. He told her he was working for the president and it was top secret but she just wouldn't stop trying to find out what his mission was. You would think that she of all people would be more respectful of boundary lines, after all she has lots in her murder investigations. But the entire way through she obsesses on it and it got quite annoying and was completely out of character.Scott and Maisie are assigned a murder investigation of an American reporter, Catherine Saxon, the daughter of an isolationist Senator. Maisie and her best friend, Priscilla, are driving ambulances at night and Saxon actually rode with them to write a story the night she was murdered. Maisie is even more determined to solve the complex murder that has lots of twists and turns.There are lots of personal things going on with her. She is trying to adopt Anna, an orphan, she has been caring for awhile. She has a budding romance with Scott. Priscilla's family is trying to recover from numerous war injuries. Maisie helps both Billy and Sandra's families to her estate to be safer from the horrible bombing.  And, of course, there is Maisie's nonstop investigation into Scott's mission.This is not my favorite book in the series. It dragged for me and I really just wanted it done by the end. Have I read too many WWII books lately? Was the writing over long? Could the author use a spark of humor in her books to lighten it up occasionally ? Yes to all of the above.", "review_score": "4"}

The prince had been buried with it in his tomb. With the help of Hassan we traversed the trials and tribulations of the temple. We found Kazal Amek\u2019s sarcophagus but sadly, too late. Lady Evelyn had gotten to it first. Her hubris was her downfall, for she had forgotten the writings on the scroll. \u201cYou enter through the eye, to get to the temple.

Finn\u2019s most talked about (highly anticipated) psychological thriller THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, most definitely lives up to the hype!  A B S O R B I N G.Just when you think you have attained your answers and you have reached the top of the mountain\u2014 think again. The climb has only begun. It is just gaining speed.  From here on out, it is non-stop action, suspense \u2014unputdownable. There are many more twists to follow before reaching the explosive ending\u2014 making this an \"engrossing\" 5 stars \u201cmust read\u201d and Top Thrillers of 2018.Audiobook Not sure I have ever been this immersed in an audiobook previously. Cannot stress enough, Ann Marie Lee (narrator) rocks! Her performance is award-winning. I was hanging on every word.  Generally, with audio, I am distracted by other work and continuously rewinding. Not the case with THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. BTW, I purchased the Kindle format, hardcover (which has not arrived from Amazon), and the audiobook.Anna, age 38 agoraphobic, cat owner, fond of wine drinking wine and pill popping to ease her fears. She likes old classic black-and-white movie classics \u2014 and she spies on her neighbors.\u201cEverything goes down better with a glass of smooth merlot.\u201dWhen Anna views the woman in the window: \"I noticed she liked a drink in the morning, as do I.\"The narrator: again, off-the-charts bloody-good. The author: So many delicious witty one-liners.Anna is a child psychologist and often advises a few patients by email. \u201cThe doctor is in.\u201dShe does not venture into the outside world; however, she does have phone conversations with her husband (ex) and her eight-year-old daughter.Readers are unsure what happened to her family and why she is in this state. However, she is in constant contact with her husband and daughter even though they live apart. We suspect something dreadful, painful, and tragic occurred.She resides in a beautiful large home in Manhattan and has a handsome tenant, who is a carpenter. He lives in her basement. Her latest highlight a new form of entertainment happens to be her new neighbors. They do not seem to have any window dressing, and she enjoys observing. (spying). Trying to figure out their life from her eyes.Ethan Russell, the son (age sixteen) lives across the street. He is a pleasant enough young man, and Anna seems to connect with him. She also meets the parents: Paul and Jane (from the window).  Then one night, after watching her usual noir films, she witnesses a crime. She is frantic! She sees a woman murdered. She immediately calls the police.However, she is not a credible witness. After all, she comes across as crazy, paranoid, unstable. Pretty much an alcoholic buzzed out on pills, and an agoraphobic.  She is beyond puzzled and begins her own investigation. The wife is OK and alive, says the cops. However, the wife is not the one she saw that night. Therefore, Anna thinks she is an imposter.  However, what is the motive? What happened to the woman in the window?She immediately begins suspecting everyone. She becomes obsessed. Picking up clues any way she can. The also has a feeling Ethan is scared of his parents and offers him friendship. Cleverly, the author unravels the reasoning behind Anna becoming an alcoholic and an agoraphobic. However, again, this is NOT the end. Do not let your guard down. Keep your spy hat in place.Anna continues to watch her Hitchcockian movies (the titles relate to parts of her investigation) and speaks to her family. Slowly she begins suspecting she is not crazy like everyone thinks she is.  However, she needs to seek solid answers before she gets the police involved again. She must find clues and confront the problem. It is not paranoia or is it?The cops think with the constant viewing of late night crime movies, in combination with her alcohol and medication she sees things that are not there.  However, Anna is more than determined to find answers to prove to herself and everyone there is something more sinister at play. In doing so, then she may be able to face her demons to begin to live a somewhat healthy life.What a fantastic book!  Brilliantly written and plotted, psychologically rich, characters well-drawn, highly emotional \u2014From love, loss, to complete madness. Anna is a woman you can sympathize with, no matter your gender or age. I listened/read in one sitting.Once you reach the 50-75% mark, you will understand why the movie rights. As mentioned in my review of  The Wives Between Us (coming Jan 9, 2018) , another huge hit 5 Stars ++ with film rights; why these two books will be on the bestseller list for some time to come: Readers are getting the \u201cbest\u201d of the literary world (expertise) with the two author's background in journalism, and the publishing world, plus Pekkannen is a well established best-selling author. These guys know what they are doing and do it well. What a way to kick off 2018!Back to TWITW: I enjoyed the second half of the book, more than the first part. The first part is a slow-burning set up for the fast-paced, intense second half.  If you have read,The Ghostwriterby Alessandra Torre Top Books of 2017 you will note some similarities when reading between the lines of the main character. (both of course with different outcomes). Fans of each- will enjoy the other.Both involve an unreliable narrator, with a mystery surrounding husband and child, and agoraphobic. Ironically, A. J. Finn\u2019s THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW also reminds me strongly of A. R. Torre (Alessandra Torre)\u2019s Deanna Madden SeriesThe Girl in 6E (A Deanna Madden Novel Book 1)(minus the erotica, UPS man, and internet sex); however, the box cutter, agoraphobic, family tragic past, and a strong pull to save someone beyond the reaches of her home, while putting herself in harm\u2019s way.Highly Recommend for fans of well-written strong, and intelligent psychological suspense thrillers. Heavy on the old movie classics, literary flair, and less on the blood and gore, which works for me. Enthralling, and all-consuming are words which quickly come to mind.  To summarize, Finn brilliantly explores the mind of Anna. Her anxiety, fears, insanity, depression, mental illness, paranoia, panic attacks, agoraphobia; love, loss, grief, and guilt \u2014hitting all cylinders.The next Gone Girl? I would say \"Yes,\" to that question. Looking forward to the small/or big screen and can imagine its cast of stars. I loved Anna! I hope we see more of her in future books.

AJ Finn's debut novel is placed in current day, gentrified Harlem, New York City, where Dr. Anna Fox spends her day in her five-story townhouse drinking Merlot, spying on her neighbors, and mixing pills to numb her thoughts. She has theories and pseudo-storylines for her neighbors, each one being unique and different in their own way. When she is not photographing and spying on her neighbors, Anna watches famous black and white movies to pass the time and regularly checks in with her daughter and husband, who she recently has separated from. Anna suffers from agoraphobia, preventing her from leaving the confines of her house and limiting her ability to experience the real world effectively. Her hours, days, and weeks are consumed by fear and curiosity. When her new neighbors move in across the park from her house, Anna is intrigued at their anonymity. As she begins to investigate the story of her new neighbors, something horribly goes wrong. Anna witnesses something that shouldn't have happened\u2014or did she?I won this ARC in a Goodreads giveaway and literally jumped out of my bed and yelled, \"YESSS!!!\" I immediately was drawn to the story because let's face it, spending time spying on your neighbors while drinking too much wine sounds like my Friday nights. I was curious to see how this story would develop and see what the hype was about. After getting hooked in right from the beginning, I figured out why. The Woman in the Window will definitely not be for everybody. The initial pacing is moderate, to say the least. I wouldn't classify it as a slow burn however, because as the story progresses, the character development of Anna and the provided characters becomes ever more intriguing. Nothing is rushed or overlooked\u2014everything is portrayed at exactly the right time. Why is Anna agoraphobic? What's her mental state like? How is she coping? What's going on in the outside world that she's missing? Who are all these people around her? These are just some of the questions that pulled me in while starting The Woman in the Window and it kept me guessing until the end.The Woman in the Window breaks away from the mold of some of the more recent in-your-face psychological thrillers that have been sprouting out more and more since the release of the book that shall not be named, and that's very refreshing to me. This type of psychological thriller really gets you in the mindset of Anna's psyche without throwing everything at you at once.As I've stated earlier, this book will not be for everyone. This thriller breaks the mold and sets a new standard\u2014so buckle up 2018!", "review_score": "5"}

Hillary loyalists, as well as never-Trumpers, spread the claims of the Russian dossier (opposition research) to the FBI which used it to spy on an American citizen connected to the Trump campaign. Eventually, the spying expanded and names were unmasked. Former FBI director James Comey notified then President-Elect Trump of the dossier. Leaks to the media began to happen. Hillary loyalists were overwhelmed with joy with the thought of a Russian conspiracy which might remove Trump from office. CNN and MSNBC ran continual coverage of a Russian conspiracy for over 2 years. Democratic Representatives, as well as so-called news hosts, made wild claims that there was hard evidence of collusion with Russia and this evidence would be used by Mueller to indict Trump. As a result, they thought this would be enough to impeach the President.\n\nAs Allan Dershowitz rightfully points out in the introduction of this book, there was a conflict of interest and there shouldn't have been a special counsel appointed in the first place! Mueller and Comey were close working buddies and the Mueller team consisted of a lot of people who donated to the Hillary campaign. But after squeezing the President's inner circle where he charged them with crimes unrelated to the investigation or during the process of the investigation and reviewing thousands of pages of documents Mueller decided not to indict on the conspiracy with Russia allegation. He left the obstruction of justice allegation up to the AG, but Barr concluded he wasn't going to indict either.\n\nThis report is a great read, taxpayers spent millions of dollars on this political investigation and you should read it. Mueller did give his Democratic friends something to keep the investigation going for as long as the President remains in office. But not for justice, the report falsified promises of an indictment. The ongoing investigations are intended solely on undermining President Trump!", "review_score": "4"}

I wish I had gotten it from the library rather than paid for it, but at least it was under $5 when I got it.  I don't really regret reading it, but it's not a book I'm going to recommend either.  It has had the kind of hype that \"connected\" authors get, but despite the author's bio which trots out his study of suspense and thrillers, I feel like he didn't really use what he'd learned in this book.  It falls in that chasm between literary fiction and mysteries, and though I enjoy both, I often find that the literary authors really needed to commit more to the genre they're writing in.The first, say, 50% was particularly slow going, so slow that I thought, well, I must have misunderstood and this is not a thriller at all.  I laughed at times, and was engaged enough to keep reading (on a day too hot to go outdoors, when I had nothing else to read), but I was really simply forcing myself to get through it.  The set up was predictable:  of course no one believes the narrator who is an alcoholic who is mixing heavy duty psych meds with her merlot.  It didn't really start getting interesting until the very end.  I did appreciate a couple of twists, so it's not like I hated the book--I just also didn't really enjoy it, and just finished it because I started it.  I think the author could have done a better job of making the first part of the book a bit more suspenseful, if it was to be a thriller.Not worth they hype, that's for sure.", "review_score": "3"}

The subject, for one -- I mean, Audrey Hepburn! And the approach: Author Robert Matzen has written eight books, Dutch Girl being the third in a trilogy on well-known actors and World War II.\n\nThere's no question that the book was exhaustively researched. There is so much information that was new to me about Hepburn's aristocratic family and their role in the fight against fascism (or, in some cases, for it.)\n\nStill, despite intriguing material and meticulous cross-referencing, the book was hard to read. Occasionally the alternating timelines got in the way. More often, reading Dutch Girl reminded me of what I dislike about televised true crime shows, where snippets of dialogue or graphic images are repeated so often that it feels like 15 minutes of content were \"crammed into\" a 43-minute (plus commercials) production.\n\nDutch Girl had lots of repetition and a good bit of rambling. It felt as if the author felt he had to honor his (undeniably good) material by casting and recasting it in a different setting.\n\nThis book is worth reading, and much of it is memorable. It simply cried out for a rigorous edit. Thanks to NetGalley for an advance readers copy.", "review_score": "5"}

It starts as a bit of a slow burn but has a ton of action towards the end.  Overall, very satisfying book.There were, however, a couple of things I didn't love.  First, there was less of Joe's family involvement in this story which is disappointing.  The reason I fell in love with this series is that you feel like a part of the Pickett family, watching the kids grow up and seeing how Joe and Marybeth navigate the minefield of parenthood.  I know the kids are older now, but I would still like to see more of the story revolve around the Pickett family.  Second, I am getting a little weary of crazy shoot-em-out stories with Joe.  I'd like to see CJ Box go back to story's that have simpler investigations.  Doesn't mean it has to be a simple story, but can have twists and turns and be a true mystery with depth.  Joe is not some bad ass ex-military guy.  Keep it simple with him.  Then have Nate out there kicking major ass in a side story line.

It kept me awake for nights because i allowed myself to think the unthinkable.The most outrageous thought abstracted from the book crossed my mind and i found it frightening and full of awe. It has an aura of death that won't make you want a second read.The story:Aman named Louis Creed moves to a town anmed Ludlow, Maine from upstate Chicago. He has just been promoted to Head of the medical department at the University of Maine. He finds friendship with an old neighbor named Judson Crandall who lives with his sick but strong wife. At the beginning we sense that Jud is an energetic character and we have warm feelings towards him. But in the Second chapter we begin to dread him.While his wife and two children are on vacation he is left home alone with his daughter Ellie's cat, Church. He is phoned by a shaken Jud who tells him Church the cat has been run over. Louis is devastated because he does not know how to tell this to his daughter who still does not accept death. JUD has an idea. A very bad one.He escorts Louis to the burial ground beyond the pure ,child created Pet Sematary beyond his yard.The Micmac burying ground. Believed to be a place of pure evil. It is here that they bury Church and Jud does not give reason to their actions.The is something  wrong with Jud, his face has a look of unbelievingly pure joy. Like something is igniting him to proceed on.The very next morning Louis awakes to find Church alive and well, but something is different. He smells of death. There is blood on his muzzle! He has an urge to kick the cat but he withdraws. The mission is accomplished.Soon later his son, a mere toddler, is hit by a truck and dies. Thoughts overwhelm Lois, surely he could bring back his son and his wife and daughter will be joyful. He does not allow the thoughts of Church's change in atmosphere distract him and he easily thinks he could play God. What a fool. We cannot blame him though, he has to carry on the mission. The burying ground is taking over his being.We already know the proceedings but what will Gage's return influence?", "review_score": "4"}

Two of the teens are going through some serious hidden real-life trauma (Allie Garvey and David Hybrinski) and two are creating their own upper-class privileged teenage angst (Sasha Barrow and Julian Browne). When a fifth teen (Kyle Gallagher) who is already experiencing a life-changing trauma is added to the group, the dynamics change. A night of drinking ends with deadly results and the teens keep that night a secret, going their separate ways.\n\nThe turning point, the unbearable secret the teens share doesn't occur until the half-way point of the novel. The lead up to the event is spent in character development of the five teens, focusing on their lives and their secrets. Then the novel jumps ahead to the future when Allie is attending the funeral of one of the group. She realizes that the decision the four made has left her with guilt that has eaten away at her ever since that one fateful night.\n\nThis is really a novel of highly dysfunctional families and a very stupid teenage mistake. The ending is over-the-top and the final twist was... head-shakenly unbelievable. Part of the problem is that you are waiting until the novel is half over for the huge game-changer and you are spending the time leading up to that focused on these teens, their problems, their emotions, and their families. Then the whole tone of the novel changes into a different novel.\n\nSince this is a Scottoline novel, she partially gets away with this because she's such a good writer. I paused only twice, wondering what was going on with the pacing while waiting for the game changing event, and then the end, which seemed like a very different novel in comparison to the first half. When I finished it, I had to wait before even trying to write a review because my initial impression was so poor. In summary, The quality of the writing is excellent, the characters are well developed, the pacing is very uneven, and the ending requires you to set disbelief aside.\n\nDisclosure: My review copy was courtesy of Penguin Random House.", "review_score": "5"}

Finn's The Woman in the Window from the Amazon Kindle store. Since its publication, I'd seen this psychological thriller advertised on all the on-and-offline bookish places I visit. It was nominated for my book club's mystery/suspense read but did not win. So, I was really excited to get some time to read it this summer - and at a discount to boot!The story is about poor ole Dr. Anna Fox who is suffering from a pretty extreme case of agoraphobia. While at home, she witnesses something sinister in her neighbor's home across the street through ... you guessed it ... the window. The book is told from Anna's point-of-view, and as the reader discovers more about this protagonist her account of what she witnessed becomes less reliable. Her mental health condition, coupled with the physical trauma that caused it, and a cast of dynamic supporting characters that serve as red herrings throughout the novel make this a true page-turning mystery for the reader.Overall, I enjoyed this book. It moved along at a good pace, and Anna was a well-developed character. I liked that she was kind of the winner and loser of her own story. Her flaws made her character realistic. There were some elements that were predictable. The bit we learn about Anna's family read like a scene from the movie The Sixth Sense. I do wonder if Mr. Finn is vying for a movie adaptation. [As an aside, it does bother me a bit when I feel like the author is writing for the book to become a movie.] But I digress. I do think the part about Anna's family was supposed to be a plot twist, but I don't know how successful it was. I saw it coming from at least 30 chapters away.And speaking of chapters, I found the book's structure odd. There were 100 chapters in this relatively short book. Some of the chapters were barely a page long. To me, a page does not a chapter make. Also, the present date preceded each section of chapters in chronological order, which I did appreciate. However, Anna had several flashbacks throughout the story and there were no date markers for those flashbacks. So, sometimes I would be a few sentences in before I realized that she wasn't narrating the present day. It caused a little confusion as did the interspersed dialogue from the old black and white movies Anna enjoyed watching. After finishing the book, I do wonder if this was intentional to give the reader a feel for how disoriented/disconnected (read: drunk and high on psych meds) Anna was.Mystery is becoming one of my favorite sub-genres of fiction, and The Woman in the Window fit the bill. If you enjoyed Paula Hawkins' The Girl on the Train or Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, you will probably enjoy this book. It has a similar tone and pace. All of these books have been on the market for awhile so you can probably borrow a copy of all three from your local library to compare!Recommendation: If you enjoy a suspense-filled novel that keeps you on your toes, this would be a good one to add to your summer reading plan.Until next time ... Read on!Regardless of whether I purchase a book, borrow a book, or am gifted one, my ultimate goal is to be honest, fair, and constructive. I hope you've found this review helpful.", "review_score": "4"}

Two of the teens are going through some serious hidden real-life trauma (Allie Garvey and David Hybrinski) and two are creating their own upper-class privileged teenage angst (Sasha Barrow and Julian Browne). When a fifth teen (Kyle Gallagher) who is already experiencing a life-changing trauma is added to the group, the dynamics change. A night of drinking ends with deadly results and the teens keep that night a secret, going their separate ways.\n\nThe turning point, the unbearable secret the teens share doesn't occur until the half-way point of the novel. The lead up to the event is spent in character development of the five teens, focusing on their lives and their secrets. Then the novel jumps ahead to the future when Allie is attending the funeral of one of the group. She realizes that the decision the four made has left her with guilt that has eaten away at her ever since that one fateful night.\n\nThis is really a novel of highly dysfunctional families and a very stupid teenage mistake. The ending is over-the-top and the final twist was... head-shakenly unbelievable. Part of the problem is that you are waiting until the novel is half over for the huge game-changer and you are spending the time leading up to that focused on these teens, their problems, their emotions, and their families. Then the whole tone of the novel changes into a different novel.\n\nSince this is a Scottoline novel, she partially gets away with this because she's such a good writer. I paused only twice, wondering what was going on with the pacing while waiting for the game changing event, and then the end, which seemed like a very different novel in comparison to the first half. When I finished it, I had to wait before even trying to write a review because my initial impression was so poor. In summary, The quality of the writing is excellent, the characters are well developed, the pacing is very uneven, and the ending requires you to set disbelief aside.\n\nDisclosure: My review copy was courtesy of Penguin Random House.", "review_score": "5"}

He does this through ingenious use of a fasting \"loophole\" that allows pure play fats.

For me, those delicious coffee drinks, fat bombs and chocolate desserts are worth the price of admission. He also highlights little-known new products that make an IF or keto or modified keto easier and yummier.

This is the straightforward, true story of Abby Johnson and tells of her rise to the position of director of an abortion clinic, and her deliverance from that hellish industry.The film accurately portrays both sides of the abortion \"argument\" and the truth about Planned Parenthood's recruiting and promotion strategies.  Abby's story could have been anyone's story, but for the grace of God!  Her journey to the directorship of a large abortion clinic was one of personal loss, denial and divided family opinions.  I was impressed by the loving faithfulness that Abby's parents exhibited during this eight year journey, and I hope I will be able to love my children as well as they did when they begin choosing their own path through life!  God showed Himself faithful and powerful in Abby's life through a number of relationships, and her ultimate turning point was reached through the life of an unborn child in a way I can't even imagine having to witness!Viewers also hear briefly from a physician who previously performed surgical abortions, and has since been delivered by the shed blood of Christ on the cross.  Both the surgeon and Abby testify to their amazement that God chose to deliver and forgive them for their past and has chosen instead to use them as powerful tools in the arsenal of truth. What an awesome testimony!!The DVD also contains information about Heartlink.org and God's provision to provide mothers an honest look into the life of their unborn child.  If you ever wondered about the abortion industry, if you ever acted upon the lies that Planned Parenthood has perpetrated on society - there is HOPE! There is SALVATION! God is ready to redeem every life!Unplanned will change the way you live and love - forgive and receive forgiveness! This is an AMAZING story!! DON'T MISS IT!!", "review_score": "5"}

Finn\u2019s novel \u201cThe Woman In The Window\u201d.This book had me hooked early on. The heartbreaking story that unfolds is evenly matched with the heart pounding thrills and mystery that begins to reveal itself nearly halfway through the book. The story does a great job of showing the flaws and struggles everyone goes through in life, and sadly how the outside world looks down on those who are struggling. Yet in all her struggles, Anna Fox does an amazing job connecting with the readers and keeping you on the edge of your seat as you question everything and suspect everyone.While this book definitely has the same engaging elements of other books like Gone Girl and The Girl On The Train, it also does a remarkable job standing out on it\u2019s own and creating a unique narrative that has so many twists and turns that you are bound to get whiplash. Often I found myself gripping the book tightly in my hands as new clues and shocking revelations would appear. By the book\u2019s end, the final revelation will have you talking for years to come.If Stephen King is the master of horror, then A.J. Finn is steadily making a name for himself as the master of thrillers. This novel was one of the more powerful reads of 2018, keeping me on the edge of my seat as I dove deeper into the inner workings of this small neighborhood and the various relationships we intentionally and unintentionally make in our lifetime. It also takes a very real look at the struggle those suffering from one ailment or another go through on a daily basis, and the hardship that comes with trusting oneself and what they see in this world.

Hillary loyalists, as well as never-Trumpers, spread the claims of the Russian dossier (opposition research) to the FBI which used it to spy on an American citizen connected to the Trump campaign. Eventually, the spying expanded and names were unmasked. Former FBI director James Comey notified then President-Elect Trump of the dossier. Leaks to the media began to happen. Hillary loyalists were overwhelmed with joy with the thought of a Russian conspiracy which might remove Trump from office. CNN and MSNBC ran continual coverage of a Russian conspiracy for over 2 years. Democratic Representatives, as well as so-called news hosts, made wild claims that there was hard evidence of collusion with Russia and this evidence would be used by Mueller to indict Trump. As a result, they thought this would be enough to impeach the President.\n\nAs Allan Dershowitz rightfully points out in the introduction of this book, there was a conflict of interest and there shouldn't have been a special counsel appointed in the first place! Mueller and Comey were close working buddies and the Mueller team consisted of a lot of people who donated to the Hillary campaign. But after squeezing the President's inner circle where he charged them with crimes unrelated to the investigation or during the process of the investigation and reviewing thousands of pages of documents Mueller decided not to indict on the conspiracy with Russia allegation. He left the obstruction of justice allegation up to the AG, but Barr concluded he wasn't going to indict either.\n\nThis report is a great read, taxpayers spent millions of dollars on this political investigation and you should read it. Mueller did give his Democratic friends something to keep the investigation going for as long as the President remains in office. But not for justice, the report falsified promises of an indictment. The ongoing investigations are intended solely on undermining President Trump!", "review_score": "4"}

The plot is not the most original, but I tore through this story like it was the wrapper on a peanut butter cup.The main character, Dr. Anna Fox, was a child psychologist. But a terrible accident has reduced her to a wine guzzling, pull popping agoraphobe. In lieu of leaving her house, she spends her days running an online support group for other agoraphobes, playing online chess, and talking on the phone to her husband and daughter, from whom she is...estranged. She also passes the time watching DVD versions of classic black and white films, which she has seen so often she can recite the dialogue. All of this happens through a wine and anti-depressant induced fog.Then, the Russell family moves in across the street. Anna used her camera lens to spy on her new neighbors. Then, just like the plot of one of the film's with which she is obsessed, she sees something through her window that leaves her gasping. The trouble is, she cannot convince anyone of the reality of what she has seen. Every time she tries, those who will not believe point to her rapidly accumulating collection of empty wine bottles and pill containers, and grimly shake their heads.The ending gets somewhat conventional, including a lengthy reveal that borders on cliche, but this story rips by in such a frenzy that readers will gladly overlook them.

Just to fit historical truths into skewed versions of history , and rewriting 21st-century intentions and shameless leftist blaming into intellectually sharp founders and great thinkers is what is occurring. The author, Ben Shapiro, solidifies the actual intent of the right's thought-leaders, with adherence to Truth and civility towards all of society. We should not be so angry, and Ben suggests keeping all worldviews on the table of our marketplace of ideas, then we can use our own minds to come to our own conclusions. Keep all ideas out there, and we have freedom to speak and debate, but the truth will set our citizenry free. Ben's writing trusts the reader, no matter what our political or religious thoughts, to come to our own conclusions.

Although the chemistry between Tessa and Hardin was interesting, I don't get how a book can be 600 pages and literally nothing happens in the plot other than class occasionally, parties, fighting, drinking... and sex. I mean, literally nothing. At certain points in the book, it was just redundant, and I started to count how many times the author wrote that Tessa snapped back at Hardin. Too many snaps my friend... too many. It also bothers me that this author took too many character life descriptions and sub-plot points from other novels... like Fifty Shades of Grey, Bared to You, and Beautiful Disaster. I realize this was fan fiction, but it read very familiar in some points of the book. But after the entire book I do have to say the ending was kind of a shocker and very climactic, and when it comes down to it I'm a sucker for sequels. So even with all the Tessa \"snap backs\" and no real plot line, I'll probably read the next book.", "review_score": "3"}

In fact Hegland addresses the AI Church and religion issue as well -- the AI people want to have a Church of AI with an ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) as the godhead. A machine can be intelligent but not conscious as humans are. Then we have the issue of AI pretending to be human, invoking the Turing Test, and there is the fantasy of downloading memories and knowledge into a machine -- without programming. Ain't gonna happen, and Hegland explains why... he takes a more metaphysical approach and equates the deeper findings of Quantum Physics with the TAO in Eastern teachings. \"Consciousness\" in a machine would have to be programmed to simulate it, and again we are dealing with simulation -- even the knowledge and memories would all have to be programmed.\nHe flat out says that consciousness is of the soul and machines do not have it (p. 281).\n\nAs for Simulation, he brings the info up to date, annoying people who do not like to hear that we are in what seems to be the Great Simulation. The reality we live in is quantized (according to Quantum Physics) which means digital and that means somewhere, someone is simulating this Reality. And this gets into what Dr Bostrom said earlier that we could be simulated consciousness in this Realm (p. 281) .... but it goes beyond that and the Simulation involves Karma, Reincarnation and soul growth (p. 285) -- which is exactly what Hegland examines in depth, and goes beyond Simulation to why we are here and what we are. .. and that pushes a new understanding of Man and this Realm, bordering on a new Faith.", "review_score": "5"}

But I also admit I'm probably one of the few people who isn't obsessed with Almost Famous and am not super interested in 70s music culture. That said, Daisy Jones, Billy, Graham, Karen, etc. all sucked me in and made me want to keep reading. And yes, this book does feel totally real; almost like the story of an actual band... To the point where I had to look Daisy Jones and the Six up just to make sure they weren't real.This book is written in a really interesting format; interview style. The \"interviewer\" compiled all of the interviews with Daisy Jones, members of The Six, and people close to them and wove them together into a coherent story, so we're hearing multiple points of view all at the same time. I loved reading about the band's rise to fame and how Daisy Jones got involved. I enjoyed the interview format, but in some ways it also left me wanting a bit more. Now that I'm done reading, I'm still thinking about the characters and wanting more details on them. I guess that's the sign of a good book! As intriguing as Daisy Jones is, I think I was more interested in Billy's family life and the relationship of Graham and Karen. I wanted so much more on their relationship!The thing I love best about Taylor Jenkins Reid is that you never know what you're gonna get from her. She's so versatile in her writing and I feel like if I didn't know I would think One True Loves, The Seven Lives of Evelyn Hugo, and Daisy Jones & The Six were all written by completely different authors. I consider this an great thing, though I'm sure some are disappointed when they fall in love with ones of her books, but get something completely different for the next.

There they find a great  danger-- the roaring highway and those orinco semi trucks and they find a  mysterious path that leads to a place called Pet Semetary. A place where  animals that the road has taken are buried. What lies beyond the deadfall  of the the place is an old Micmac Indian burial ground where the dead can  rise... The story is mainley about Louis's obsession with the graveyard but  I think that the story also tries to focus on the relationship between  Louis Creed and his 80 something year old neighbor Jud Crandall.If you  do decide to read the book I strongly suggest that you not watch the movie  first. It is not very good and will ruin alot of the key parts of the novel  for you. The movie is short and gets into too muck sub plots of the novel  and lacks characterization.The novel takes it's time in getting down to  business. (it's over four hundred pages long.) That leaves alot of room for  you to fall in love, (or hate) some of the characters.It is filled with  death, love, ressurection, humor, and so on. I reccomend everyone read it.", "review_score": "5"}

The \"gentleman\", Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, was placed under house arrest inside of the grand luxurious, Metropol Hotel in Moscow in 1922. The Count's life was spared by the Bolsheviks because of their displeasure with a poem he wrote while at the University.\n\nThe story begins a few years after the Russian Revolution when violence was still the norm. The Count is called before the Emergency Committee for Internal Affairs for writing a poem deemed counter-revolutionary. While the hotel is grand and artsy, the Count's room is tiny and cramped. Despite this, for decades the Count remains a perfect gentleman never complaining about his circumstances.\n\nI loved everything about this story, it was tender as well as humorous at times. The grand hotel and the people the Count encounters during his stay are well explored. Clearly, the Count is the winning star here, a man so gentle and full of love. The story took me by surprise as I'm not fond of the time period but, the writing is spectacular and the story a gem. I never expected to be so drawn into the story and the time period.

That said, the story is so well done and the (relatively) slow start is so brief that I cannot downgrade it.  The Huntress follows a similar pattern to its predecessor: rotating chapters around principal characters with one in flashback that works its way close to the present.  This novel is richer (and longer) in comparison to The Alice Network because instead of two principal characters there are three.Without trying to outline the novel, the primary story is basically about post WW II independent Nazi hunters (Ian and Tony) operating out of Vienna for one of whom a certain target has become personal in spite of his philosophical belief that it shouldn\u2019t.  There is a secondary story of Jordan, a young woman in post-war Boston dealing with both the divide between her creative career aspirations and the conventional family expectations as well as getting to know her widowed father\u2019s new wife.  Finally, there is a deep flashback story that develops Nina from her rough pre-war childhood on the shores of Lake Baikal, Siberia to her most personal post-war participation in the Nazi hunting (in a sometimes lunatic, sometimes somber and sometimes comic style).  Along the way Nina\u2019s progress introduces us to the incredible story of the Nachthexen\u2014the Night Witches\u2014an all-female night bomber aviation group who attacked German positions in cloth and plywood bi-planes.  It turns out this is actual history (even if the characters are fictional) and the Night Witches are a part of WW II history that was new to me.So, once you get started, this book is a fast read, and I was truly sorry when it ended.  It has rich (but not over done) character development and the humanity of each is explored.  There\u2019s plenty of symbolism (we meet each of our three principal characters by a lake) and the characters share, in places, parallel personal fears or demons.  If you enjoyed The Alice Network this book is definitely for you.  If you haven\u2019t read it but enjoy crisp, well written historical novels you should really look into reading both that book and The Huntress.  Personally, I\u2019ll be looking to read more of Kate Quinn\u2019s work.", "review_score": "5"}

But that also meant I had extremely high expectations for the sequel!\n\nWhile Elisa's story took place in Cuba during the revolution and Marisol's in the present day, Beatriz's story takes place among the Cuban exiles living in south Florida in the years after the revolution and sheds light on the situation many refugees found themselves in, having to watch tyranny take over their beloved island from afar, worried about loved ones they left behind, struggling to adjust to their new reality in a new country.\n\nAs a famous socialite in Cuba and a scandalous one in America, beautiful, intelligent, and sensuous, with ties to both the revolutionaries and the resistance, Beatriz Perez is quick to catch the attention of not only every bachelor in Palm Beach, but also the CIA. Beneath the carefree facade she presents in public, Beatriz is angry. Very angry. And her anger needs an outlet. Lured with the promise of helping bring down Fidel Castro, Beatriz becomes a spy.\n\nBut there are complications. Beatriz falls in love for the first time, with a powerful man, and their relationship could present a threat to her ambitions and the nation's security. She constantly feels the disapproval of her parents and their pressure to preserve their good name by behaving herself and catching a good husband. Resistance fighters and radicals have infiltrated Palm Beach society. Russia's new alliance with Cuba brings America to the brink of nuclear war. And Beatriz grapples with her conscience and her heart's desires and must ultimately decide where her allegiance lies and how far she is willing to go to prove it.\n\nThe story begins with a prologue featuring Beatriz as an older woman in 2016 that leaves you wondering which of the many men in her life is sending her champagne on the day Fidel Castro dies. Interspersed with Beatriz's adventures are a few more scenes from 2016 that ratchet up the anticipation of discovering how the past storyline plays out, and this book consumed me so much it seriously gave me anxiety. Whenever I had to put it down to go back to real life, I thought about it constantly till I could get back to it.

Suspense is hard to write - especially in a first chapter when you don't know or care about the characters yet.  This book pulls you in right away.Our library mystery group has read about 75 mysteries - and we're always on the lookout for an intriguing plot with writing which has a literary quality.  Those books are in short supply.  This novel supplies it.As soon as you read the first pages of this book, you realize that this is not standard mystery fiction as enjoyable as that can be.  This writing is on another level.  But it doesn't outshine the original story.The setup is rather Hitchockian with a twist: woman at window thinks she has witnessed a murder.  But is she a reliable narrator?  The amount of wine she consumes daily makes her suspect.  While the story unfolds, you want to say to her, please put the wine bottle down, sober up, and pay attention to what is really happening around you.  Something is not right, and you need to figure it out.  You may be in danger.What this tale has going for it: a sympathetic narrator, an unusual situation, the narrator's interest in old films which are constantly referenced, and a lot of unknowns which tease the reader.  Why does she spend so much time at the window?  What about her family?  Why does she drink so much?Did she really see what she thought she saw?This deserves to be a best-seller, and an Amazon book of the month when it's published.  It is adroitly written.  The author seems to combine natural talent with experience and understanding of the book world, so she knows what will captivate sophisticated readers.

But that also meant I had extremely high expectations for the sequel!\n\nWhile Elisa's story took place in Cuba during the revolution and Marisol's in the present day, Beatriz's story takes place among the Cuban exiles living in south Florida in the years after the revolution and sheds light on the situation many refugees found themselves in, having to watch tyranny take over their beloved island from afar, worried about loved ones they left behind, struggling to adjust to their new reality in a new country.\n\nAs a famous socialite in Cuba and a scandalous one in America, beautiful, intelligent, and sensuous, with ties to both the revolutionaries and the resistance, Beatriz Perez is quick to catch the attention of not only every bachelor in Palm Beach, but also the CIA.

Lured with the promise of helping bring down Fidel Castro, Beatriz becomes a spy.\n\nBut there are complications. Beatriz falls in love for the first time, with a powerful man, and their relationship could present a threat to her ambitions and the nation's security. She constantly feels the disapproval of her parents and their pressure to preserve their good name by behaving herself and catching a good husband. Resistance fighters and radicals have infiltrated Palm Beach society. Russia's new alliance with Cuba brings America to the brink of nuclear war. And Beatriz grapples with her conscience and her heart's desires and must ultimately decide where her allegiance lies and how far she is willing to go to prove it.\n\nThe story begins with a prologue featuring Beatriz as an older woman in 2016 that leaves you wondering which of the many men in her life is sending her champagne on the day Fidel Castro dies. Interspersed with Beatriz's adventures are a few more scenes from 2016 that ratchet up the anticipation of discovering how the past storyline plays out, and this book consumed me so much it seriously gave me anxiety.

But after reading this book, I actually liked her less.\n\nWe all know Barbara Bush was known for her sharp tongue...and, considering her reaction to Donald Trump, Mrs. Bush could obviously \"give much better than she could get\". While as a Mother, I would also have disliked Donald Trump for referring to my son's low-energy...but blaming President Trump for a 92 year old woman having heart issues is a bridge too far. The book also made several statements about Mrs. Bush jogging in Memorial Park in Houston. Really? Does anyone believe she was a jogger? Come on.\n\nI am not sure how Barbara Bush could have championed abortion (including late term abortion) after losing her own child at age three. I suspect the statements in the book may reflect the author's own beliefs since after the author broached the subject with Barbara Bush, Ms. Bush should have been able to defend her opinion based on a child's right to life. --Barbara and H.W. Bush did not attend Robin's original burial either (the remains were later moved to the Presidential Library at Texas A&M University.) Why did they not attend? I understand they sat by Robin's side as much as possible before little Robin died...but I have never known anyone who \"chose\" not to attend a close loved one's funeral. They made time for golf. ...it seems they could make time for their dear child's burial.\n\nHowever, I appreciated Barbara Bush's honesty about depression. I hope her openness will help others work through their issues and realize there is a brighter future ahead of them. She had to have a true sense of survival to make it through her life changing events.\n\nI also appreciate Barbara Bush's charitable efforts on behalf of adult literacy.

Its doable. It reminds me of the TV show when they cheated the fans and had to do a flashback to make it right.

She is deft at providing enough cultural context to orient her reader, without ever making one lose the escapist experience  and feel as if she is lecturing.In her latest work her setting is not China but the island of Jeju, off of Korea.  I was so captivated by her description of the family roles that I HAD to know if she was inventing them.  Off to google to investigate.  It turns out that once again she has done careful research and the lives of her characters accurately reflect the unusual practices here.  While being a highly traditional society, the women are in many ways the heads of household, and are the earners, by diving for edible sea life of all kinds.  The men cook and clean and care for young children.  This way of life is passing as the last practitioners are growing very old.All of that is just context for a complex saga of the long lives of two women who are inseparable friends as children, but who go their separate ways in young adulthood. The plot moves quickly and covers career, marriage, children, war, occupation, and more,This is  a rich, evocative read that will stay with me for a long time.  I think it will appeal to fans of Lisa See's previous work, as well as new readers who may be drawn to the unusual setting.", "review_score": "4"}

There is something very cinematic about the way this is written, it really is begging to be a movie and I\u2019ll be anxiously awaiting it\u2019s eventual release.The best psychological thrillers keep you guessing and there is much back and forth here. Anna is a woman on the brink, she\u2019s unraveling at the seams but she isn\u2019t your standard, is she reliable or isn\u2019t she narrator. I was fascinated by the insight into Anna\u2019s mind and loved not knowing exactly what she would do next, that sense of unease is a must for me in a psychological thriller. Not only is she incredibly well drawn the entire book is multifaceted and well accomplished, you can tell that Finn knows exactly what he\u2019s doing and every element of the plot has a purpose, a reasoning behind it and I was blown away several times while reading this.This starts off slower but the pacing gradually increases throughout the book all the way up until a breathless, tense ending. There was something menacing about the style of this book, an unnerving feeling that made me anxious but also totally engaged. It\u2019s on the longer side, especially in my experience of a thriller, but at no point did it feel drawn out or just too much. You know how sometimes it seems like authors are trying to hard, whether it\u2019s with crazy, unbelievable plot twists or overdone writing that drags on? There was not a hint of that here and the fact that this is a debut is all the more impressive, I\u2019ll be following Finn\u2019s career closely.", "review_score": "5"}

But that also meant I had extremely high expectations for the sequel!\n\nWhile Elisa's story took place in Cuba during the revolution and Marisol's in the present day, Beatriz's story takes place among the Cuban exiles living in south Florida in the years after the revolution and sheds light on the situation many refugees found themselves in, having to watch tyranny take over their beloved island from afar, worried about loved ones they left behind, struggling to adjust to their new reality in a new country.\n\nAs a famous socialite in Cuba and a scandalous one in America, beautiful, intelligent, and sensuous, with ties to both the revolutionaries and the resistance, Beatriz Perez is quick to catch the attention of not only every bachelor in Palm Beach, but also the CIA. Beneath the carefree facade she presents in public, Beatriz is angry. Very angry. And her anger needs an outlet. Lured with the promise of helping bring down Fidel Castro, Beatriz becomes a spy.\n\nBut there are complications. Beatriz falls in love for the first time, with a powerful man, and their relationship could present a threat to her ambitions and the nation's security. She constantly feels the disapproval of her parents and their pressure to preserve their good name by behaving herself and catching a good husband. Resistance fighters and radicals have infiltrated Palm Beach society. Russia's new alliance with Cuba brings America to the brink of nuclear war. And Beatriz grapples with her conscience and her heart's desires and must ultimately decide where her allegiance lies and how far she is willing to go to prove it.\n\nThe story begins with a prologue featuring Beatriz as an older woman in 2016 that leaves you wondering which of the many men in her life is sending her champagne on the day Fidel Castro dies. Interspersed with Beatriz's adventures are a few more scenes from 2016 that ratchet up the anticipation of discovering how the past storyline plays out, and this book consumed me so much it seriously gave me anxiety. Whenever I had to put it down to go back to real life, I thought about it constantly till I could get back to it.

It becomes clear from the beginning that both are the offspring of parents that have little regard for ethics, morals, or the rule of law. The adage, \"... the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree...\" fits well. This extremely well documented book, portrays Jarred and Ivanka as individuals that have an extremely high opinion of themselves along with a highly inflated sense of importance; neither have the knowledge nor the experience to support such a belief. In both cases, lies and deception are acceptable practices if it is for their self benefit. The glamour of Ivanka is tarnished when one learns that her efforts in the business community ended, like her father, in failure. Jarred, with the support of his criminal father, made seriously flawed real estate decisions forcing him to seek financial support from foreign entities. His belief that he was some sort of diplomat, conditioned by his personal self interests financially, nearly led to all out war in the Middle East. His lack of respect for the U.S. Intelligence community led him to disclose highly classified documents and names to the Saudi Crown Prince, which led to the imprisonment of over 200 individuals. These are only a couple of examples describing the gross incompetence Jarred and Ivanka possess. By the end of the book, any reasonable person might think neither should be allowed anywhere close to any government office. This is a good read, well documented, and the vast majority of information is readily available in the public domain.

Beatriz has a lot of anger towards the man responsible for all of the turmoil in her home country, Fidel Castro, and so she agrees to work as a spy for the CIA and infiltrate Castro's inner circle.

It's fair to say she will be forced to make a lot of tough choices, some with lasting consequences.\n\nI was slightly worried before reading this that it was going to read too much like a spy novel, which isn't really my thing. However, while Beatriz working for the CIA is definitely part of the story, there are other facets of her life that are explored as well. Overall there really was a nice balance to the story. I was drawn the most to Beatriz and her love life but I also enjoyed learning some of the historical facts regarding what was going on between Cuba and the United States during this time. It was also nice to revisit characters from the previous book.\n\nDefinitely an enjoyable read and I would love to see the author continue on with featuring Perez family members in future books.\n\nThank you to First to Read for the free advance digital copy!

It didn't disappoint. I left the biography with a greater understanding of Audrey Hepburn. It added depth to a woman who is usually just recognized for her career and role as a fashion icon.\n\nAudrey's own words are included in this historical account of her life, and there is an interesting foreword by her son Luca Dotti, who shared his own research with the author.\n\nHow World War II impacted Audrey's childhood is clearly explained, and it is fascinating as well as shocking to read. I think it's easy to forget how severely World War II altered the lives of citizens living in Europe. I've read my share of historical books about World War II, but I really appreciated how the history was related to Audrey Hepburn's life.\n\nAudrey's mother was an especially riveting figure to read about, and like all parents had attributes and flaws that impacted her children. I appreciated how honest the author was in portraying Audrey's mother. The good, the bad, and the ugly is shared.\n\nI didn't find this biography dry at all. It's readable, engaging, and surprisingly touching. It is DENSE. This biography is packed with information, and because of that I found it was best read in chunks over a period of several days. Like other reviews have mentioned, this biography isn't for low-key Audrey Hepburn fans. This doesn't focus on the glamorous side of her life. People interested in learning more about Audrey Hepburn's formative years will be satisfied, and leave with a deeper understanding of the actress.", "review_score": "5"}

I'll explain the joke in a minute.Stephen King--literary master?  Thematic genius?  No, no, stick with this review.  I swear, he is.  It is very easy to overlook the thematic depth to this novel--in fact, I would pose that he wrote this book as a suspense because, well, he's good at suspense, but also because we can easily ignore important clues when we are not aware of them.  Would you have read \"The Shining\" for literary themes unless someone told you to look for them?  Whatever, ....Jack, Wendy, and their son Danny are set to spend a winter and spring in The Overlook Hotel in remote Colorado as caretaker and family.  This family, though, has a complicated and dark history, a history about as dark and complicated as the hotel itself.  We understand, going into the hotel, that Jack is a troubled man, a recovering alcoholic still yearning for the drink with a violent temper.  Wendy lives in fear of becoming her mother.  And Danny\u2014Danny possess a gift, a shining, kind of like ESP or second sight or sixth sense-ish stuff.  He can see dead people.  It\u2019s not good.  Neither is the hotel; as its sordid history unfurls, the reader realizes that the Torrance family is a pawn.  The question is, does the pawn know about the game and can it win?But the book is not thrills and chills, scares and dead bodies.  It is more complicated than that, but it an aspect that most people overlook (hint!).  King is speaking to the importance of history, the complex contexts that guide our lives\u2014and the harmful implications of overlooking (hint!) that history.  Just like many people disregard a literary effort by King, so too can most reader fail too the complexity within this novel.  I must be frank\u2014I did.  If I wasn\u2019t taking an English lit class, I would have simply read this book as a scary, cool suspense novel.  I would not have seen the depth or the significance of the context and layers King deftly places in this book.  How easy we forget.Moreover, each character\u2019s action is justified and valid.  This is a rich and justified character study; Jack, even when he is at his most crazed, still has elements of humanity that ground him in reasonability.  In other words, this book never spins to such an outlandish degree that we disregard the truth.  These characters could exist, they could be your neighbors.  And that is what the most successful element of suspense within this novel is\u2014it is believable.  And in its believability, it gains a new level of tautness.  If these were chariactures, why would we care?  Also, the events are suspenseful on their own\u2014Dick\u2019s return is littered with mundane events that create a nail-biting effect.  King is the master of detail.  But you miss one\u2014you\u2019ve overlooked it all.I highly recommend this novel--not only as a \"don't read at bedtime\" chiller, but as a strong exploration of Santayana's creed: the importance of understanding history or living with its ... consequences.", "review_score": "4"}

He spent years conducting interviews for this book, trying to get us to wrap our heads around the gun violence in Chicago. This achingly sad and equally frustrating book points out the many causes: grinding poverty, easy availability of guns, tempers that are entwined with male pride and respect, lack of family structure, poor schools, lousy communication and lack of trust in police and politicians, etc. Actually, nothing much new here. He shines a light in all the corners; no one is blameless. But no one has any answers, either. Many of his stories have glimmers of hope, people who desperately hope to stop the cycle of violence, but hope without a plan for success is just another road to failure.

She sees a murder and nobody believes her. Lots of fun there, too. The house is unusual with four stories and a basement. and the tenant in the basement is rather unique. Cool characters traipsing in and out of her bubble of a life via a protected hallway to a locked door, a camera enabling her to judge whether that person should come into her world. The set up is great.Also, the writing is wonderful. Her turns of phrase caught me off guard sometimes with their beauty and/or uniqueness. Made me want to reread them, commit them to memory.The problem is that the pace carried a little too much weight with it, and therefore, I saw some of the twists coming a mile away. The author gave me too much time to analyze what happened before throwing something new at me to catch me unawares. And I kept wondering why she kept letting people into her house. It turned into Grand Central Station after the first few chapters. Sounded like more of a resort than a fearful, agoraphobic situation. Not that I did not enjoy the story. I did.

It changed civilization; this book travels from Archimedes (-212) computing pi to today\u2019s design of airplanes.
